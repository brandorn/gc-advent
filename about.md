<h1>About the Devotional</h1>

<p>Suffering. War. Poverty. Sickness. Death. Fear. Grief. The world Jesus was born into was marred by the same exhaustion and weariness as ours. God’s people cried out for mercy, deliverance, and redemption, much as we do. God chose to join us in our weary world and brought good news of great joy for all people. God showed up.</p>

<p>As the season of Advent returns, we’re invited to rejoice again in the good news of Emmanuel, God with us. But how do we find joy in the midst of our weary world? We begin by acknowledging our weariness. We discover joy in our connection with God and others. We allow ourselves to be amazed by God’s surprising arrival in our lives. We sing stories of hope. Oh how we need to sing! And we make room for the God who chooses to dwell among us.</p>

<p>We have designed this Advent devotional to help you prepare for the celebration of God’s arrival and the return of Jesus Christ for the renewal of all things. Each week will have its own section with a theme, and each day, except Sunday, will include a Scripture passage and a reflection created by one of our own Gathering Church folks.</p>

<p>We hope this Advent devotional encourages our community to hold space for both our weariness and our joy, imagine ways to practice joy in a weary world, and remember that our joy comes from knowing we are beloved and belong to God.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Long lay the world in sin and error pining,<br>
 Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.<br>
 A thrill of hope - the weary world rejoices,<br>
 For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn!
 O Holy Night</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

<p>I hope these small, artistic pieces will serve as doorways into the scriptures and the devotionals written by members of our church family.</p>

<p><i>Acknowledge Weariness</i>, an abstract, desert piece, calls to mind dryness and our heart's thirst for God. When we read of John's call to prepare the way for the Messiah, John speaks of our need for a Redeemer while in the desert himself. <i>Be Amazed</i> depicts an example of life suddenly springing forth from a dry tree stump. This new life is a sign of the child who shall become our Redeemer and a call back to the prophecy of a peaceable kingdom in Isaiah 11.</p>

<p>I noticed, as I was making the art, the contrast between our weak and human state and the overwhelming holiness of God. God’s beauty is displayed as God breaks into our world to announce the birth of Jesus. I tried to depict some of that wonder and beauty in both the <i>Discover Joy</i> and <i>Make Room</i> pieces. The angel Gabriel first appeared to Zechariah, Mary and Joseph. On the night Jesus was born, the night sky became filled with an awe-inspiring army of angels that came to the shepherds. Later, the guiding star brightened the sky and led the wise men to the young child, Jesus.</p>

<p>Finally, <i>Sing Hope</i> is a drawing of a young, pregnant Mary. I wanted to focus on her love for God and her intimate worship. I drew her holding the rose, which is often associated with Mary, and a palm. After I finished the drawing, I learned that the palm symbolizes the victory of the faithful over the enemies of the soul, a beautiful reference to our redemption.</p>

<p>About the Medium: <i>Acknowledge Weariness</i>, <i>Discover Joy</i>, and <i>Be Amazed</i> are collages using handmade paper, rice paper and tissue paper. <i>Sing Hope</i> is ink and watercolor pencil on paper. Finally, <i>Make Room</i> is ink on handmade rag paper.</p>

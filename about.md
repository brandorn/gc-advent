<h1>About the Devotional</h1>

<p><b>Do not be afraid.</b></p>

<p>Those words are the most repeated command in the Bible, which means Scripture isn’t telling us to ignore our fears or pretend they don’t exist. On the contrary, God recognizes we have ample opportunities to be afraid. But in the face of our fear, we have a choice. We can remain in our fear or reject fear and choose love. “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love” (2 Tim. 1:7).</p>

<p>We chose “do not be afraid” for our Advent theme because fear seems to be lurking around every corner: a tumultuous political season, a pandemic with ceaseless ripple effects, persistent racial and social inequities, and the list could continue. During this season of Advent, we cling to the hope that God has not left us to face our fears alone. We have good news: God is with us.</p>

<p>Because God is with us, we have the courage to face our fears with honesty and the conviction that we can overcome our fears. We do our best to reject fear, even when we’re afraid. “When I am afraid, I put my trust in you” (Ps. 56:3). We refuse to act out of fear.</p>

<p>God continues to give us this message today: Do not be afraid, for I am with you. Reject fear. Choose love.</p>

<p>We have designed this devotional to encourage you and help you prepare for the celebration of God’s arrival and the renewal of all things in Jesus Christ. Each week will have its own section with a theme, some practices to help you experience that theme, and a short memory verse.</p>

<p>New reflections will be available each day (except Sunday) and will post at the top of the website. These will include a Scripture passage and a reflection created by one of our own Gathering Church folks. We encourage you to share these posts with friends and family, and we pray this devotional gives you courage to turn away from fear and toward love.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>So do not be afraid, for I am with you;<br>
do not be dismayed, for I am your God.<br>
I will strengthen you and help you;<br>
I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.</p>
	<p class="source">Isaiah 41:10</p>

<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

<p>This has been a year of looking. Sequestered at home by the pandemic, our experience of the world has been limited by what we can see around us: through our windows, through our screens, in our rooms. For many, this limitation has been oppressive. We want to get out! To travel and visit with others, to go to our favorite places without concern for our health. I feel these things too, but I have also come to savor this near-sightedness, the things I notice when I'm stuck at home, the habits of mind and sight that I feel taking root. I look at things differently than I did a year ago.</p>

<p>For this year's advent devotional, I've made a set of instant photo triptychs: three juxtaposed images of people and places around North Carolina. They mostly focus on the natural world, something that has been a stabilizing presence to me through these difficult months. The trees and plants and animals are blissfully unaware of the virus plaguing our nation and world. They go about their vegetable and animal lives, follow their own rhythms without care for the morrow — something we never seem to be able to do. This poem by Wendell Berry describes the peace that can come when we rest in their peace:</p>

	<p class="title">The Peace of Wild Things</p>
	<p class="author">by Wendell Berry</p>
	<p class="poem">When despair for the world grows in me <br>
	and I wake in the night at the least sound <br>
	in fear of what my life and my children’s lives may be, <br>
	I go and lie down where the wood drake <br>
	rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds. <br>
	I come into the peace of wild things <br>
	who do not tax their lives with forethought <br>
	of grief. I come into the presence of still water. <br>
	And I feel above me the day-blind stars <br>
	waiting with their light. For a time <br>
	I rest in the grace of the world, and am free.</p>

<p>One triptych stands out from the others, the images of the Durham County Detention Facility in downtown Durham. Walking past the austere buildings on a sunny afternoon, I found myself reflecting on parallels between or collective experience of the pandemic and the lives of imprisoned people: the pain of isolation we feel, the limitations imposed on our lives, the indeterminacy of return to "normal life." Even if we cannot presently visit the imprisoned in person, we can visit them in our minds, and hearts, and prayers.</p>

<p>Triptychs are a form of early Christian art from the Middle Ages, typically paintings of scenes from Scripture. They would be placed prominently in churches and the homes of wealthy patrons, and used for devotional purposes. They form a tripartite view of things, something worth reflecting on. And for the readings, I wanted to make something that felt <i>tactile</i> at a time when we experience images in increasingly abstract, commodified ways. I also wanted to create something that felt down-to-earth, even throwaway. Vision is available to all of us. We're forever surrounded by scenes of beauty and significance, no matter where we are. We just need a little willingness to look.</p>

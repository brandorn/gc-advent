<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

<p>Just like the Bible, we decided to let our art speak to both literal light and figurative light. The one thing that became clear as we created these pieces: your eye is always drawn toward the light. May we be drawn to God’s light, trust that he’s at work in dark places (our own and the world’s), and share the light of his love with those around us.</p>

<h1>About the Devotional</h1>

<p>When we think of God’s presence, we often imagine light, brilliant and blinding. Our sacred stories contain numerous examples of God appearing in light. However, God’s presence isn’t limited to brightness. God shows up in the shadows and the dark as well. We are invited to dwell in God’s shadow and discover God in the night.</p>

<p>After Gabriel’s incredible announcement to Mary about bearing Jesus, she asks how all this will happen. Gabriel responds, “The Holy Spirit will come over you and the power of the Most High will overshadow you” (Luke 1:35). The language of “overshadow” is used elsewhere in Scripture to indicate God’s presence, usually with a cloud. When God overshadows us, we find a place of power, refuge and revelation.</p>

<p>We chose “Overshadowed” for our Advent theme this year to help improve our night vision, our ability to see God in the dark, and to remind us we live in the shadow of the Almighty.</p>

<p>We have designed this devotional to help you prepare for the celebration of God’s arrival (in both light and darkness) and the return of Jesus Christ for the renewal of all things. Each week will have its own section with a theme, some practices to help you experience that theme, and a memory verse.</p>

<p>New reflections will be available each day (except Sunday) and will post at the top of the website. These will include a Scripture passage and a reflection created by one of our own Gathering Church folks. We encourage you to share these posts with friends and family, and we pray this devotional helps you discover God’s presence in light and darkness.</p>

<blockquote>
	<p>You who live in the shelter of the Most High,<br>
who abide in the shadow of the Almighty,<br>
will say to the Lord, “My refuge and my fortress;<br>
my God, in whom I trust.</p>
	<p class="source">Psalm 91.1-2</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

<p>Just like the Bible, we decided to let our art speak to both literal light and figurative light. The one thing that became clear as we created these pieces: your eye is always drawn toward the light. May we be drawn to God’s light, trust that he’s at work in dark places (our own and the world’s), and share the light of his love with those around us.</p>

<h1>About the Devotional</h1>

<blockquote>
	<p>As you therefore have received Christ Jesus the Lord, continue to walk in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.</p>
	<p class="sans-small">Colossians 2.6-7</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A healthy root system is essential for the thriving of life. Good roots provide access to necessary nutrients. They maintain vital connections to other organisms in the vast network of life. Strong roots provide stability and help sustain life in times of lack. And we're not just talking about plants.</p>

<p>This agrarian language fills the pages of Scripture: our first home was a garden, we're made from soil, we have been planted by God beside streams of water, and we are rooted in Christ and branches abiding in the vine of his love. The Spirit is calling us to cultivate deeper roots with Christ, our neighbors, and all of creation.</p>

<p>Daily we face the temptation to think of ourselves as individuals who can do it all on our own. We have more "connections," but we're more isolated than ever. We lack belonging. We chose "Rooted" for our Advent theme this year to keep us grounded in our bodies, to remind ourselves that we belong to God and one another, to help us tend to the health of our soil/spirits, and to keep us connected to the source of life: Father, Son, and Spirit.</p>

<p>We have designed this Advent devotional to help you prepare for the celebration of God's arrival and the return of Jesus Christ for the renewal of all things. Each week will have its own section with a theme, and each day, except Sunday, will include a Scripture passage and a reflection created by one of our own Gathering Church folks. We pray this devotional helps you (re)discover your connection to God, your neighbors, and God's good world.</p>

<h2>Artist Statement</h2>

<p>Isaiah 11 has been a much loved passage for me. The image of a dead stump coming to life through a new shoot is powerful. Isaiah prophesies that Jesse, the father of David, will be the new line through which will come the Messiah. And as believers now, we are grafted in to this lineage. Advent reminds me that God's great plan of redemption started humbly, through a dead stump, and brings us a King also through humble means. Hopefully, we can reflect on being rooted in our faith, and work to share all that has been given us.</p>

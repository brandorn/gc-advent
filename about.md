Do not be afraid.
Those words are the most repeated command in the Bible, which means Scripture isn’t telling us to ignore our fears or pretend they don’t exist. On the contrary, God recognizes we have ample opportunities to be afraid. But in the face of our fear, we have a choice. We can remain in our fear or reject fear and choose love. “For God has not given us a spirit of fear, but of power and of love” (2 Tim. 1:7).

We chose “do not be afraid” for our Advent theme because fear seems to be lurking around every corner: a tumultuous political season, a pandemic with ceaseless ripple effects, persistent racial and social inequities, and the list could continue. During this season of Advent, we cling to the hope that God has not left us to face our fears alone. We have good news: God is with us.

Because God is with us, we have the courage to face our fears with honesty and the conviction that we can overcome our fears. We do our best to reject fear, even when we’re afraid. “When I am afraid, I put my trust in you” (Ps. 56:3). We refuse to act out of fear.

God continues to give us this message today: Do not be afraid, for I am with you. Reject fear. Choose love.

We have designed this devotional to encourage you and help you prepare for the celebration of God’s arrival and the renewal of all things in Jesus Christ. Each week will have its own section with a theme, some practices to help you experience that theme, and a short memory verse.

New reflections will be available each day (except Sunday) and will post at the top of the website. These will include a Scripture passage and a reflection created by one of our own Gathering Church folks. We encourage you to share these posts with friends and family, and we pray this devotional gives you courage to turn away from fear and toward love.

So do not be afraid, for I am with you;
do not be dismayed, for I am your God.
I will strengthen you and help you;
I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.
Isaiah 41:10

scripture_passage: In the sixth month of Elizabeth’s pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a town in Galilee, to a virgin pledged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. The angel went to her and said, “Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you.” <br> <br> Mary was greatly troubled at his words and wondered what kind of greeting this might be. But the angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary&#59; you have found favor with God. You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you are to call him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over Jacob’s descendants forever; his kingdom will never end.” <br> <br> “How will this be,” Mary asked the angel, “since I am a virgin?” <br> <br> The angel answered, “The Holy Spirit will come on you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the holy one to be born will be called[a] the Son of God. Even Elizabeth your relative is going to have a child in her old age, and she who was said to be unable to conceive is in her sixth month. For no word from God will ever fail.” <br> <br> “I am the Lord’s servant,” Mary answered. “May your word to me be fulfilled.” Then the angel left her. <br> <br> At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of Judea, where she entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. In a loud voice she exclaimed&#58; “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! But why am I so favored, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfill his promises to her!”

When life feels uncertain, we return to God’s promises as our source of hope. Our hope in God serves as an anchor for us during the storms of life. Hope represents the possibility for transformation, that God isn’t done with us or our world yet. We are still becoming who God created us to be. We hold onto the hope for a future that is different from our present reality. This week’s passages and reflections will help you reach out and cling to hope. Do not be afraid to hold hope this week, even if it feels a little risky.

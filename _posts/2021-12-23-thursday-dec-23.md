scripture_passage: Now many signs and wonders were done among the people through the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon’s Portico. None of the rest dared to join them, but the people held them in high esteem. Yet more than ever believers were added to the Lord, great numbers of both men and women, so that they even carried out the sick into the streets, and laid them on cots and mats, in order that Peter’s shadow might fall on some of them as he came by. A great number of people would also gather from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those tormented by unclean spirits, and they were all cured.

<b>Casting Your Shadow</b>

In this text, the apostles are faithfully continuing the work Jesus began in his brief time on earth. In the power of the Holy Spirit, they are performing many signs and wonders, and word quickly spread of these miraculous acts. Crowds of desperate people began flocking to the apostles seeking relief and healing.

Imagine their worn cots and mats laid side by side and end to end filling the crowded, dusty street. I imagine them scanning the crowd as they anxiously look for Peter to walk into their midst. In their suffering and hopelessness, they believed that healing was possible even from Peter’s shadow. 

If you’ve ever lived in the shadow of someone else, you know it can be a frustrating feeling. It’s like you can’t really be YOU! Ever hear the words, “why can’t you be more like your sister or your brother?” I did!

But living in the shadow of the Almighty is perhaps the most liberating and safest place to be. Psalm 91:1 promises “Whoever dwells in the shelter of the Most High will rest in the shadow of the Almighty.” The Almighty’s shadow is a liberating place because I can just drop, catch my breath and release it all - the good, the bad and the ugly. The Almighty’s shadow is safe because God’s presence harbors love (John 4:16), security (John 10:27-29), strength (Isaiah 41:10), peace (John 16:33) and so much more.

Living in God’s shadow and being filled with the Spirit reminds me that I too cast a shadow. What does my shadow look like? What does it feel like when you step into my shadow? Is it sharply defined by the brilliance of the Spirit and love? Or is it barely visible because I’m allowing life’s circumstances to overshadow God’s light?

As we strive to love others incredibly well, let’s be ever mindful and intentional of the shadow we’re casting to those searching for rest and healing!

scripture_passage: Now the boy Samuel was ministering to the Lord under Eli. The word of the Lord was rare in those days&#59; visions were not widespread. <br><br> At that time Eli, whose eyesight had begun to grow dim so that he could not see, was lying down in his room&#59; the lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was. Then the Lord called, “Samuel! Samuel!” and he said, “Here I am!” and ran to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call&#59; lie down again.” So he went and lay down. The Lord called again, “Samuel!” Samuel got up and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But he said, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.” Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord, and the word of the Lord had not yet been revealed to him. The Lord called Samuel again, a third time. And he got up and went to Eli, and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” Then Eli perceived that the Lord was calling the boy. Therefore Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down&#59; and if he calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, Lord, for your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

In the opening of 1 Samuel 3, we find the young boy Samuel in the care of Eli. But it seems that the tables have turned, and the roles have switched. Samuel offers care for Eli. The two of them rest in the temple of the Lord on what appears to be a quiet and seemingly ordinary evening.

And yet, on this ordinary evening, God shows up. Communication from the Lord was rare in those days. That can feel familiar to many of us. Why would Samuel ever think the voice he continued to hear belonged to anyone other than Eli? Samuel responds by going quickly to help Eli, to meet whatever he needs – saying, “Here am I; you called me.” He makes himself available. Eli’s recognition of what’s really happening takes time. After three attempts, he realizes Samuel hears the Lord. The Lord’s voice had not been revealed to Samuel yet. His only concern was to be a faithful caregiver to Eli. His first response was to help this one in need.

As a caregiver to family and friends, I can relate to Samuel’s response of rushing to meet a need, to faithfully care. We are called to love those in need, to serve those closest to us. Samuel shows us a picture of his calling and ours: to love the Lord and those who have been entrusted to us. What a beautiful view of a community growing in love to care for one another.

At times, we need others to help us recognize the call of the Lord’s voice. When we finally do, may we answer in faithful action without always knowing what is next. Let us step out in faith even if we don’t have all the answers or resources. May we answer, “Here am I; you called me.”

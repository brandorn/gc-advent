scripture_passage: Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet&#58; <br><br> “Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son,<br>and they shall name him Emmanuel,” <br><br> which means, “God is with us.” When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him&#59; he took her as his wife. <hr> <p>In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.” Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you&#59; therefore the child to be born will be holy&#59; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son&#59; and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord&#59; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.</p>

Wisdom and insight can be received in the dark of night. In this week’s passages and reflections, God shows up in the night and reveals, comforts and even blesses human beings. God promises to be with us in the darkest times, sharpening our vision and bringing clarity to our next steps. While we might not have the full path laid out before us, God’s word is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. Where might God be asking you to step out in faith?

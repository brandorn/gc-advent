scripture_passage: When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.” So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

Once the bright light of the angels disappears, the shepherds’ surroundings return to the darkness of night. As they head out in search of this newborn baby, Jesus, they must do so in the dark and readjust their sight. But they have been transformed; they have seen the light. Their journey is filled with purpose and promise. As we move through our world in times of light and darkness, we have been changed by the Light of world, and we have the light of life within us. Let us shine bright.

scripture_passage: But your loyal love, Lord, extends to the skies&#59; <br> your faithfulness reaches the clouds. <br> Your righteousness is like the strongest mountains&#59; <br> your justice is like the deepest sea. <br> Lord, you save both humans and animals. <br> Your faithful love is priceless, God! <br> Humanity finds refuge in the shadow of your wings. <br> They feast on the bounty of your house&#59; <br> you let them drink from your river of pure joy. <br> Within you is the spring of life. <br> In your light, we see light.

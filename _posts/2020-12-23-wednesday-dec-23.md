scripture_passage: But your loyal love, Lord, extends to the skies&#59; <br> your faithfulness reaches the clouds. <br> Your righteousness is like the strongest mountains&#59; <br> your justice is like the deepest sea. <br> Lord, you save both humans and animals. <br> Your faithful love is priceless, God! <br> Humanity finds refuge in the shadow of your wings. <br> They feast on the bounty of your house&#59; <br> you let them drink from your river of pure joy. <br> Within you is the spring of life. <br> In your light, we see light.

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-a.svg"><span>A</span> line in the Christmas song “Away in a Manger” goes like this, “But little Lord Jesus, no crying He makes.” I always thought this was kind of funny, an interpretation of a sinless baby, I suppose. Personally, I think Jesus bawled like babies do when they need something, something like a swaddle, a parent’s warm body, a mother’s milk, a voice of comfort and familiarity, a song or food or fresh air. All the things. When I think of fear or being afraid, it conjures up visions of hiding or running away or sinking into myself. Being silent. Not causing a fuss. Being “strong.” Saving face. I build up all these walls around myself to keep fear out and to keep my own needs in. But the very relief I am in such need of, the love that is given so freely, is not here inside my walls. That love is beyond my walls and my own tightly held expectations and yet right within reach, right within earshot. That warm body, that sustenance of the soul, that peace that passes understanding. Right. Out. There. Do I think Jesus wanted that love and sought it out and was sustained by it? I do. So as a baby, I think he cried because babies need love, and they don’t have walls yet.</p>

But He did grow up. He wept when his friend, Lazarus, died. He went to his friend Peter and asked, “Do you love me?” He celebrated a wedding. He felt the oils and hair wash over his feet from his beloved friend Mary. He went to twelve men and said, “Follow me,” and they would become his closest friends and companions. He moved towards love. But how scary. How vulnerable. How risky. One of his friends betrayed him and He became so unbearably afraid. He went to his Father in heaven and pleaded: let this pass. Please let this pass. Jesus does not hide. He does not steal away. He does not feign apathy. He does not close into himself.

As we have found this year, with all our protective attempts to create a sterile and controlled environment, here we still are with our fears. The masks, hand sanitizer, and handwashing can’t take away all this uncertainty, and we are as vulnerable as ever.

I am reminded that the love made flesh in Jesus was not a sterile, controlled, no-anxiety love. Sterile, uncomplicated, fearless love does not start in a manger and end on a cross. Oh, but how Jesus taught us to live amidst our unpredictable and sometimes scary world! Perhaps Jesus drew from the Psalms as we do and reflected on God’s love and ran towards it with bawling and open arms.

Love is everywhere and right out there; love is in the mountains and in the deep; love is snuggling for refuge under a wing and feasting in abundance in the house. This love brought forth life, and that life brought light to humanity. In a world that was not perfect and is not perfect, this love continues.

We can all write our own psalm about God’s great love. How would you describe it?  My prayer is that we unclench our souls, break down our walls, open our eyes and hearts, and lift our heads and hands. Run, swim, ski, cycle, walk, do what you do to get to that Love and wallow and snuggle in it. And I’m not too proud to bawl or yawp either.

On one of my first trips to the Middle East, after a long day of walking archaeological sites, my shoes melted. I guess it might be more accurate to say that the soles of my shoes began to rapidly separate into their component layers, but since it was approaching 110 degrees that day, I assume that heat was a contributing factor. The other major factor was, no doubt, the amount of walking I had been doing for many days on rough and sandy surfaces which was far different from the nicely paved sidewalks I was used to in my usually sedentary academic life. In any case, while I had the luxury of being able to purchase a replacement pair of shoes in the city before continuing on with my travels, I got a glimpse that day of the kinds of harsh conditions of the “desert-wilderness” that the Bible so often describes.

What is so striking about the passage of today’s reflection is how it builds from the image of a crocus sprouting in the wilderness (a hopeful, but not bewildering idea) to depictions of a complete reversal of desert-like conditions that seem increasingly to defy logic. Streams gushing in the wilderness, sand pits turning into water pools, not to mention the blind seeing, the deaf hearing, and the lame jumping like deer. It might as well describe melted shoes coming back together. But that is the nature of divine salvation. It is the breathing of life into places where there was no life, the introduction of hope in what might seem the most hopeless of situations&#59; it is the reversal of entropy.

“A highway shall be there, and it shall be called the Holy Way,” the passage caps off with a paved sidewalk spontaneously emerging in the desert on which the redeemed would travel in joy and safety. No melting of shoes here. Like the raining of manna from the sky, this road is the kind of divine provision that leaves no doubt that its origin is divine.

<b>Is there an area of your life that appears hopeless, devoid of life, or fear-inducing? If so, what would a truly divine transformation of that situation look like?</b>

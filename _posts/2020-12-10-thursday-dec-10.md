How do I write about peace during these chaotic times?

The Hebrews understood peace as part of God’s original plan. As Curt mentioned in his sermon on peace, peace is shalom in Hebrew; it involves forgiveness and right relationships. Peace is dependent on righteousness and justice. The opposite of peace? Chaos.

I think you will join me in saying that 2020 has been a year of chaos. I know some of you have experienced some wonderful events this year, e.g. the birth of children and new jobs. Congratulations!! Others of you have experienced significant loss—the loss of loved ones,  the loss of a job, the occurrence of cancer, the onset of mental health problems, being separated from loved ones because of COVID-19, the loss of many in-person activities (oh, how I miss seeing y’all at church. Oh, how I miss seeing the kids grow!).  So many new and challenging ways of living.  A friend said recently, “even the small losses seem acute.”

Then, there are the events of the nation and the world. We all know what’s happening there. 
All this adds up to chaos and uncertainty for me. So overwhelming! A potential gateway to hopelessness and despair. Where do I find peace?  

In my quest for peace, I am drawn first to the Psalms of lament: “How long O Lord? Will you forget me [us, the world] forever?” (Ps 13). “O LORD, the God who saves me, day and night I cry out before you” (Ps 88).

I need to cry out to God for what is happening in our world. I need to cry for me, for you, for people I have never met going through wilderness times. I need to cry out for those who may be losing hope. I need to cry for a world that God loves so much.

But how does lament lead me on a path to peace? Maybe this sounds like a paradox, but lament leads me to gratefulness and rejoicing. Because lament compels me to go to God. It makes me lean on a mighty and good God, a God who knows our sorrows and is not overwhelmed, a God who is joyous with us, a God who constantly watches over us (Ps 121), a God who is full of mercy and grace in the midst of chaos.

Years ago, when the life of a loved one and I were in chaos, a trusted friend recommended that this chaos might be an occasion for grace. At the time, I didn’t understand.  I was hurting, and this seemed like a non-answer. But now I understand.  And I know in seeing God’s lavish grace, in experiencing that lavish grace, I find peace.  In the current chaos, I find that grace most evident in neighbor loving neighbor. 

I recently read a story about a generous woman in Bay City, Michigan.  Her mother had passed, and she wanted to honor her mother’s legacy of hospitality. Her mother fed anyone coming into her home, be they well-off or not. The daughter started a food box on her property. It looks like a little free library. One box said, “Take what you need.” The other box said, “Leave what you can.” The free food was gone every day and many times the other box was replenished.  When it wasn’t, the daughter provided her own food even when she lost her job. Other people set up their own boxes around the city. God’s lavish grace on display! Neighbor loving neighbor.  Rejoice! 
I am grateful that we attend a church that loves its neighbors well. Though we are not a large church, we have been able to help many through our COVID-19 relief fund. People have received rental, food and medical assistance. Folks have had temporary housing paid for. Creekside students have received scholarships to attend DPS Remote Learning Centers. This is not even the whole list!  God’s lavish grace on display. Neighbor loving neighbor. Praise God!

In looking for a different passage in Isaiah for my devotional, I “stumbled” across Isaiah 30:18. Reading it immediately brought me peace. Another example of God’s lavish grace on display. Once again, the Israelites have turned from God and his promises.God again offers them an opportunity to repent and rest in their salvation. But no, they refuse. God chastises them but like so many times before doesn’t give up on them. Instead, God longs to be gracious and compassionate towards them.

How many times have I been like this? How many times have I turned away and not trusted in God’s promises? How many times have I not loved my neighbor? How many times have I worshipped false gods? How many times have I ignored God’s grace in my life? Guilty on all counts. Yet, God longs to be gracious and compassionate to me. God longs to be gracious and compassionate to you, our church and this world. 

I like to read and pray through Isaiah 30:18 this way:

“[Yet even in the chaos and uncertainty], the Lord longs to be gracious to you [Laura, Gathering Church, Chapel Hill/Durham, United States, the world]; he rises to show you compassion [Insert your name here, your loved ones, your city, our country]; For the Lord is a God of justice [thank you Jesus because the world needs your redemption, reconciliation and restoration more than ever.  Give us the strength, courage and wisdom to partner with you to bring your peace—your shalom—to this earth]. Blessed are all who wait for him [help us to be active in the waiting Lord. Help us to love our neighbors incredibly well the way Jesus did].

How can we practice peace together? How can we trust in God’s grace for ourselves and others during these unprecedented times? How can we be the harbingers of peace to a broken world especially if we have difficulty finding peace for ourselves? Do not be afraid. Be blessed in waiting on the Lord. This Advent, trust that the Prince of Peace is coming.

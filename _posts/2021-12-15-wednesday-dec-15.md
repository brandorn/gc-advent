scripture_passage: The Lord said to Moses, “I will do the very thing that you have asked; for you have found favor in my sight, and I know you by name.” Moses said, “Show me your glory, I pray.” And he said, “I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim before you the name, ‘The Lord’&#59; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But,” he said, “you cannot see my face&#59; for no one shall see me and live.” And the Lord continued, “See, there is a place by me where you shall stand on the rock&#59; and while my glory passes by I will put you in a cleft of the rock, and I will cover you with my hand until I have passed by&#59; then I will take away my hand, and you shall see my back&#59; but my face shall not be seen.”

A few years ago, I met a baby in the intensive care unit who was born with a serious heart defect. He spent the first 50 days of his life being kept alive by machines, and his parents faithfully stood by his bedside every hour of every one of those days. On his 50th day of life, the baby boy died. As is customary after the passing of a child, the hospital staff cleaned the baby, removed all his lines and tubes, wrapped him up and allowed his parents and family time to be with his body as they grieved. Because this boy had been so sick, his parents had been unable to hold him until moments after he died. Once he was placed in his mom’s lap something amazing happened - he started to breathe again. This baby, who was just declared dead, came back to life. His mom sat in that chair in the middle of his ICU room holding her son for the next 24 hours without ceasing, until he stopped breathing again. 

When I think of “overwhelming light,” I think of this family and their story. I have never witnessed a child come back to life after being declared dead aside from this boy and likely never will again. This light though, this resurrection story, doesn’t have a happy ending. This family did not get to take their baby boy home. He lived 51 days.

I want “overwhelming light” to mean brightness and ease that is overwhelming in its expanse - light that is everywhere all the time. What I have been learning the past year, though, is that the most overwhelming of light is more about intensity than breadth. Light is brighter when there is dark all around, though I wish that wasn’t true.

In this passage, God promises Moses that he will be able to experience the glory of God and then covers his eyes until only God’s back can be seen. The light is too bright, God says, but I will give you all my glory that you can handle. Like looking at a solar eclipse through a pinhole so as not to burn our retinas, God promises Moses that even the shadow of the light, or the tiniest of light against the blackest of darkness, will be sustaining and fulfilling and exactly what we need.

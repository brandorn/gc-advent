scripture_passage: After John was put in prison, Jesus went into Galilee, proclaiming the good news of God. “The time has come,” he said. “The kingdom of God has come near. Repent and believe the good news!” As Jesus walked beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew casting a net into the lake, for they were fishermen. “Come, follow me,” Jesus said, “and I will send you out to fish for people.” At once they left their nets and followed him. When he had gone a little farther, he saw James son of Zebedee and his brother John in a boat, preparing their nets. Without delay he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.

After forty-five years in full-time ministry (thirty-five as a pastor), it sure feels different not to be responsible to lead a ministry or church. Although, as a follower of Christ, I continue to share the same calling and responsibility we all have to his Church and its mission.

In the mornings I have had more time to reflect, to remember, and to be refreshed by the truths about God that are still transforming me. I’ve been reminded of other transitions in my life, especially the one when as a sophomore in college I was fully captured by the love of Christ. I had a new Hope, a hope with a capital ‘h.’ It was the Hope in Christ, that I could know him, serve him, and live for the glory of God like him. Even now I am inspired in writing about it.
As I think about this Hope, I recognize it had two enduring effects on me. First, it wiped away the trivial hopes for which I was living. I did not know they were trivial, like hopes for material success and status. But in comparison to knowing Christ, they were nothing.  The hopes that were not wiped out were transformed. The hope to be loved and the hope to have friends were now shaped by the love of Christ. That transformation is what prepared me to meet the woman I would marry.

Second, that Hope gave me courage, starting with the courage to love Libby and to imagine my life with her. Then the courage to follow Christ into a vocation I never wanted.

In ministry I have done things that others said must have taken great courage. It never felt like great courage.  Following Christ made it seem too natural, inevitable. Now as I watch my adult children take risks and accomplish things that I could never imagine, I see the same unconscious courage in them.  With Christ they can’t help themselves.
In our passage today Jesus begins his public ministry by announcing the time has come, the kingdom of God is near. It’s time to turn toward God and accept his Good News.

He calls his first disciples. They leave their boats and their lives to follow him. How brave they were. But I bet they didn’t feel brave; it seems like it was irresistible. Jesus was that compelling. He called them to a new Hope, one defined by being with him.

But I must admit. Transitions are scary times. I’m launching a new life, a new career even. And if I survive COVID-19, I’ll add pandemics to my list of things to avoid. And, oh, I can’t watch the news right now because of the election. I am afraid.

I need to remember what got me out of the boat in the first place. Or, rather, Who got me out of the boat. Only Jesus can keep us from being afraid all the time.

Psalm 143:3-6 describes being pursued by an enemy, being crushed to the ground, in darkness, as good as dead. That sounds hopeless. What does the writer do? The psalmist remembers the days of long ago and meditates on what God has done.

What hope got you out of the boat?

Or better, what about Jesus made you follow?

Prayer:

<i>Our Father, the God of all hope, thank you for sending Jesus into this hopeless world. Thank you for his call on our lives. We love and trust him as our Hope. Amen.</i>

For your memory, may I recommend:

scripture_passage: A shoot shall come out from the stump of Jesse,<br>and a branch shall grow out of his roots.<br>The spirit of the Lord shall rest on him,<br>the spirit of wisdom and understanding,<br>the spirit of counsel and might,<br>the spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.<br>His delight shall be in the fear of the Lord.<br><br>He shall not judge by what his eyes see,<br>or decide by what his ears hear;<br>but with righteousness he shall judge the poor,<br>and decide with equity for the meek of the earth;<br>he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth,<br>and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked.<br>Righteousness shall be the belt around his waist,<br>and faithfulness the belt around his loins.<br><br>The wolf shall live with the lamb,<br>the leopard shall lie down with the kid,<br>the calf and the lion and the fatling together,<br>and a little child shall lead them.<br>The cow and the bear shall graze,<br>their young shall lie down together;<br>and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.<br>The nursing child shall play over the hole of the asp,<br>and the weaned child shall put its hand on the adder's den.<br>They will not hurt or destroy<br>on all my holy mountain;<br>for the earth will be full of the knowledge of the Lord<br>as the waters cover the sea.<br><br>On that day the root of Jesse shall stand as a signal to the peoples; the nations shall inquire of him, and his dwelling shall be glorious.

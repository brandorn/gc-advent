<h2>A Poem By Juanita Horton</h2>

<p class="caption">Submitted In Juanita’s honor and memory by her husband, Ron Austell
Written in 1954</p>

I stumbled through the blackness<br>
Down a path of dark despair.<br>
No beauty could my eyes behold<br>
No glory had been there.

My soul cried out for mercy<br>
My heart needed a friend.<br>
I stumbled through the blackness<br>
A despair with no end.

A hand touched mine.<br>
I gazed into eyes of love.<br>
“Ask and ye shall receive”<br>
Said a voice from above.

Then there came this light<br>
A blinding light, yet good.<br>
“Come follow me,” said a voice.<br>
And I knew He meant even I could.

I took his hand and began to walk<br>
Down a path with no dark corners<br>
Down a path where<br>
You need not balk.

Are you alone and lost?<br>
Do you sorely need a friend?<br>
Then seek my Master, love’s Amen.<br>
He’ll see you to the end.

No soul need stumble blindly.<br>
No soul need to walk alone.<br>
My God’s hand will guide you,<br>
My God’s hand will lead you home.

scripture_passage: After forty days Noah opened a window he had made in the ark and sent out a raven, and it kept flying back and forth until the water had dried up from the earth. Then he sent out a dove to see if the water had receded from the surface of the ground. But the dove could find nowhere to perch because there was water over all the surface of the earth; so it returned to Noah in the ark. He reached out his hand and took the dove and brought it back to himself in the ark. He waited seven more days and again sent out the dove from the ark. When the dove returned to him in the evening, there in its beak was a freshly plucked olive leaf! Then Noah knew that the water had receded from the earth. He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but this time it did not return to him.

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-h.svg"><span>H</span>olding onto hope is an act of faith—faith in a promise that it is well with my soul—faith that God’s plan and intentions for me are good on a scale that may not be clear to me at any given moment (Jeremiah 29:11). There are times in life when things look bleak, as though God has forgotten you. Those moments come in the form of a dove returning to the ark without good news or the days immediately following Christ’s crucifixion or waiting for a pandemic to end so job, family, and travel are “normal” again. In these times it can be hard to hold hope, but there is good news: God has been and will be present with us in the waiting and will fulfill his promises in the end. Just as Noah brought the dove back into the ark with no sign of the waters receding, yet sent it back out one week later believing in change, we too should trust in God’s faithfulness and not be afraid to hold hope!</p>

<i>Dawn in the Valley</i>

The shadow in the valley
turns dark as night. <br>
In the long wait for dawn, <br>
Will there ever be light? <br>
 
Will redemption come  <br>
When new babies cry? <br>
Or does the heaviness stay <br>
Because others still die?
 
Help me in waiting for <br>
Light to break anew. <br>
Through your eyes show me <br>
What you want me to view. 
 
There is laud in lament. <br>
There is joy in the sorrow. <br>
There is meaning in the stay. <br>
For there is hope in tomorrow.

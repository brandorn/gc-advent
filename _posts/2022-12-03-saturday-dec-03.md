scripture_passage: In the sixth month the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a town in Galilee called Nazareth, to a virgin engaged to a man whose name was Joseph, of the house of David. The virgin’s name was Mary. And he came to her and said, “Greetings, favored one! The Lord is with you.” But she was much perplexed by his words and pondered what sort of greeting this might be. The angel said to her, “Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have found favor with God. And now, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, and you will name him Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his ancestor David. He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of his kingdom there will be no end.”<br> <br>Mary said to the angel, “How can this be, since I am a virgin?” The angel said to her, “The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you&#59; therefore the child to be born[d] will be holy&#59; he will be called Son of God. And now, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son, and this is the sixth month for her who was said to be barren. For nothing will be impossible with God.” Then Mary said, “Here am I, the servant of the Lord&#59; let it be with me according to your word.” Then the angel departed from her.

One of the kingdom principles we see throughout Scripture is the power of a seed and small beginnings. The Word of God is described as a seed in the parable of the sower, showing believers how the truth of God can be embedded in fertile ground, growing roots and eventually bearing fruit. 

In today's passage we see an element of this principle played out. As Mary received the news from the angel that she will bear the son of God in her virgin body, she wrestled with disbelief. "How will this be, since I am a virgin?" I can relate to Mary's questioning as I too can hear God's word and struggle with belief. I wonder how many times others have wrestled with questions such as "How can this be, since the doctors say otherwise?" "How can this be, since it's not how I've seen things play out in the past?" "How can this be, since my grown child has not been home for years?" All these questions and more can be asked about Scripture and life with God when we read the beautiful promises of God and yet the truth cannot find roots in our souls because of our experiences. 

Thankfully the angel of God uses the testimony of a loved one to plant a seed of faith in Mary and help her start growing roots with this seed of good news she's received. "And behold, your relative Elizabeth in her old age has also conceived a son." Behold, this woman who was told she could not have children is experiencing God's miraculous power. Through the testimony of others, God's truths can take root in our lives. Things that seem impossible can be easier to grasp as we hear stories of God working in the lives of others. What stories of God's power can you share with others to grow deep roots in the body of Christ?

I'm reminded of Maverick City's song "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LM1qrx0Huds&feature=youtu.be">I Thank God</a> ,"whose lyrics remind us: "That means what he did for another, he can do it again." Just as Elizabeth's story helped grow roots for Mary's news that she would carry the son of God, so also may our testimonies bring forth deep belief in God's power and promises in our lives.

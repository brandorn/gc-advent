scripture_passage: In the beginning was the Word <br> and the Word was with God <br> and the Word was God. <br> The Word was with God in the beginning. <br> Everything came into being through the Word, <br> and without the Word <br> nothing came into being. <br> What came into being <br> through the Word was life, <br> and the life was the light for all people. <br> The light shines in the darkness, <br> and the darkness doesn’t extinguish the light. <br>  <br> A man named John was sent from God. He came as a witness to testify concerning the light, so that through him everyone would believe in the light. He himself wasn’t the light, but his mission was to testify concerning the light. <br>  <br> The true light that shines on all people <br> was coming into the world. <br> The light was in the world, <br> and the world came into being through the light, <br> but the world didn’t recognize the light. <br> The light came to his own people, <br> and his own people didn’t welcome him. <br> But those who did welcome him, <br> those who believed in his name, <br> he authorized to become God’s children, <br> born not from blood <br> nor from human desire or passion, <br> but born from God. <br> The Word became flesh <br> and made his home among us. <br> We have seen his glory, <br> glory like that of a father’s only son, <br> full of grace and truth.

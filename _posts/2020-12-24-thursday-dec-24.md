scripture_passage: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was with God in the beginning. Through him all things were made&#59; without him nothing was made that has been made. In him was life, and that life was the light of all mankind. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. <br> <br> There was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify concerning that light, so that through him all might believe. He himself was not the light&#59; he came only as a witness to the light. <br> <br> The true light that gives light to everyone was coming into the world. He was in the world, and though the world was made through him, the world did not recognize him. He came to that which was his own, but his own did not receive him. Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God—children born not of natural descent, nor of human decision or a husband’s will, but born of God. <br> <br> The Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us. We have seen his glory, the glory of the one and only Son, who came from the Father, full of grace and truth.

Have you ever taken a walk in the dark? Whether it was an unlit hallway in your own home or a dimly lit path on unfamiliar ground, you had to move slowly and tread carefully. Despite your caution, you probably have whacked your shin or slipped and fallen.

Most of 2020 has felt like we’re walking in the dark, stumbling through life without much light to guide the way. We have the bruises to prove it. We’ve been living on strange terrain indeed. We’ve experienced so much uncertainty, and we’re admitting how little we can see ahead of us.

John of the Cross was a sixteenth-century monk whose best-known work is The Dark Night of the Soul. In reflecting on his work, Barbara Brown Taylor writes, “We are never more in danger of stumbling than when we think we know where we are going. When we can no longer see the path we are on, when we can no longer read the maps we have brought with us or sense anything in the dark that might tell us where we are, then and only then are we vulnerable to God’s protection.” I know I’m feeling that vulnerability these days.

Our present condition requires trust in God to lead us, to show us the way, to hold our hands as we trip, to deliver us from our fears. Has there ever been a time this wasn’t the case? We can’t help but recognize it now. The path before us is shrouded in darkness.

Thankfully, we worship a God who can see in the dark. Our God has excellent night vision.

If I say, “Surely the darkness shall cover me,
	and the light around me become night,”
even the darkness is not dark to you;
	the night is as bright as the day,
	for darkness is as light to you. Psalm 139:11-12
God works well in the dark. Take the book of Exodus for example: the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt happens at night; God parts the Red Sea at night; manna falls from the sky in the wilderness at night.

God loves to show up in the dark and shine a light. Remember Genesis 1 and Isaiah 9. And in today’s passage: “The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.” No matter how dark, the light never stops shining. As St. Francis of Assisi reminds us: “All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle.” We have this powerful light in us. We’ve been made radiant by the light. We are the light of the world Jesus says.

Do not be afraid to shine your light in the world. We need you to shine. Your neighbors need you to shine. Maybe your light is helping guide someone home safely, like a lighthouse. Or maybe your light is providing warmth to someone, like a campfire on a cold night. Or maybe your light is calming the fears of someone who is afraid of the dark, like a nightlight. Shine on.
If you’re struggling to see the next step on the path before you, I leave you with this prayer from Thomas Merton.

> My Lord God, I have no idea where I am going. I do not see the road ahead of me. I cannot know for certain where it will end. Nor do I really know myself, and the fact that I think I am following your will does not mean that I am actually doing so. But I believe that the desire to please you does in fact please you. And I hope I have that desire in all that I am doing. I hope that I will never do anything apart from that desire. And I know that if I do this you will lead me by the right road, though I may know nothing about it. Therefore, I will trust you always though I may seem to be lost and in the shadow of death. I will not fear, for you are ever with me, and you will never leave me to face my perils alone. Amen.

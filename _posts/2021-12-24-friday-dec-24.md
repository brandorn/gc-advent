scripture_passage: When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let us go now to Bethlehem and see this thing that has taken place, which the Lord has made known to us.” So they went with haste and found Mary and Joseph, and the child lying in the manger. When they saw this, they made known what had been told them about this child&#59; and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them. But Mary treasured all these words and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen, as it had been told them.

Our Advent meditations began with the account of the young, Nazarene girl, Mary, who made herself available to be completely overcome by the love of God. And now our meditations end with Mary, who has no doubt suffered ridicule and scorn along with all the challenges of pregnancy and the pain of giving birth.
 
Having borne three sons of my own, I can imagine a little of what Mary endured—but only a little. My own path to motherhood ran along traditional lines, with a loving husband, caring parents and parents-in-law and a supportive community cheering me on. As I look back on my time as a young expectant mother, I remember the fears and doubts and pains, but those memories are mostly overshadowed by the memories of anticipation and excitement.
 
We know a few details of Mary’s journey but not many. We know that Joseph thought about divorcing her but was persuaded by an angel to take her as his wife, and as such she traveled with him to Bethlehem. Before that, she spent some time with her cousin Elizabeth, who recognized her as the mother of the Lord. What a blessing that must have been to Mary! And then Mary sang a song of praise, wherein she proclaimed, “My soul magnifies the Lord, and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior.”
 
Mostly what we know about Mary’s pregnancy is that she surrendered herself to God, and God sustained her. And now, on the night that would come to be celebrated as Christmas Eve, Mary’s long wait is over, and she holds her baby. That’s a scene I can picture, as I remember the joy of seeing my baby boys’ faces for the first time. Fatigue and pain are eclipsed by wonder and joy.
 
But as Mary tends to her newborn, she is not left alone to rest and recover. Angels sing the glad tidings of her baby’s birth. Shepherds come in from the fields to catch a glimpse of the little one.
 
Mary takes it all in. She treasures every detail of those first moments and hours and days of her baby’s life. I understand that. Ask any of us who have borne children, and we’ll tell you: that’s what a new mother does. Like it happens for any new mother, Mary’s world has forever changed.
 
But not just her world. Reaching far beyond a stable in Bethlehem, a seismic shift has occurred. Through the vessel of Mary’s willing heart and body, the whole world has forever changed. And more than anyone else on earth, Mary understands what has happened.
 
The Eternal Son has become her son.
 
A popular carol from the 1990’s asks poignantly:
Mary, did you know that your baby boy would one day walk on water?
Mary, did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters?
 
I suppose the implication is that this young girl could never have guessed the import of what had happened. Maybe that’s true. Perhaps Mary could not have comprehended the greatness of the baby she had just borne. But I’m inclined to think that Mary did know. Not every detail, most likely, but as she “treasured these things and pondered them in her heart,” I think she understood.
 
God’s love had overwhelmed her. God’s love had sustained her. And now God’s overwhelming, sustaining love would be extended to everyone, everywhere.

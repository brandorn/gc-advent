scripture_passage: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.

Darkness exists. Denying its presence would be foolish. Sometimes the darkness, and the fear that accompanies it, can feel overwhelming, as if all light has disappeared. But as St. Francis of Assisi reminds us, “All the darkness in the world cannot extinguish the light of a single candle.” John 1 teaches us the darkness does not overcome because God’s life is light in the darkness. God’s presence with us in the darkness gives us a place of refuge and courage to face our fear. The light of God shines in and through us, even in the darkness.

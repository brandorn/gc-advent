When life feels uncertain, we return to Godâ€™s promises as our source of hope. Our hope in God serves as an anchor for us during the storms of life. Hope represents the possibility for transformation, that God isnâ€™t done with us or our world yet. We are still becoming who God created us to be. We hold onto the hope for a future that is different from our present reality. This weekâ€™s passages and reflections will help you reach out and cling to hope. Do not be afraid to hold hope this week, even if it feels a little risky.

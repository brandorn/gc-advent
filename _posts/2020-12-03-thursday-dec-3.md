scripture_passage: A few days later, when Jesus again entered Capernaum, the people heard that he had come home. They gathered in such large numbers that there was no room left, not even outside the door, and he preached the word to them. Some men came, bringing to him a paralyzed man, carried by four of them. Since they could not get him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof above Jesus by digging through it and then lowered the mat the man was lying on. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, “Son, your sins are forgiven.”

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-h.svg"><span>H</span>ope. When you hear that word what feelings come to you? For me, it’s excitement, fear, anticipation...the list could keep going. In Mark 2:1-5 we see Jesus returning home to Capernaum after his time outside the city healing and teaching people throughout Galilee.</p>

As the story opens, word is spreading throughout the city about Jesus’ return. Expectations are high. The visual of the house overflowing is something that can feel overwhelming but so exciting. The people can’t wait to hear what Jesus has to say.

But what about the paralyzed man? How frustrating and heart wrenching to know that Jesus was so near, yet he was unable to get into the home let alone to Jesus. Despite this seeming setback, the paralyzed man and his friends do not lose hope and turn around after seeing their access to Jesus blocked. I can honestly say that my faith in different seasons of life wouldn’t have been that determined. How about you?

Not only do we see hope. The courage and persistence of the four people carrying him is on public display. They don’t see the crowd as a deterrent. They choose to think outside the box and find a way for the paralyzed man to meet Jesus. It was a serious physical act to lift him safely to the roof, dig through the roof, and then to then lower him down safely into the house. Because of their faith and hope, they did not let the fear of potential dangers stop them. Even though they speak no words, Jesus sees their bold belief and forgives the man of his sins.

To have witnessed the act of bold faith in the crowded home must have been not only shocking but life affirming. They dared to hope and walk in faith that they would see Jesus. May we do the same.

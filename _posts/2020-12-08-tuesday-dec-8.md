scripture_passage: But in the days to come, <br> the mountain of the Lord’s house <br> will be the highest of the mountains&#59; <br> it will be lifted above the hills; <br> peoples will stream to it. <br> Many nations will go and say&#58; <br> “Come, let’s go up to the mountain of the Lord, <br> to the house of Jacob’s God, <br> so that he may teach us his ways <br> and we may walk in God’s paths!” <br> Instruction will come from Zion <br> and the Lord’s word from Jerusalem. <br> God will judge between the nations <br> and settle disputes of mighty nations, <br> which are far away. <br> They will beat their swords into iron plows <br> and their spears into pruning tools. <br> Nation will not take up sword against nation&#59; <br> they will no longer learn how to make war. <br> All will sit underneath their own grapevines, <br> under their own fig trees. <br> There will be no one to terrify them; <br> for the mouth of the Lord of heavenly forces has spoken. <br> <br> Each of the peoples walks in the name of their own god&#59; <br> but as for us, we will walk in the name of the Lord our God <br> forever and always.

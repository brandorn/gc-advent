scripture_passage: In the last days <br> <br> the mountain of the Lord’s temple will be established <br> as the highest of the mountains&#59; <br> it will be exalted above the hills, <br> and peoples will stream to it. <br> <br> Many nations will come and say, <br> <br> “Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, <br> to the temple of the God of Jacob. <br> He will teach us his ways, <br> so that we may walk in his paths.” <br> The law will go out from Zion, <br> the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. <br> He will judge between many peoples <br> and will settle disputes for strong nations far and wide. <br> They will beat their swords into plowshares <br> and their spears into pruning hooks. <br> Nation will not take up sword against nation, <br> nor will they train for war anymore. <br> Everyone will sit under their own vine <br> and under their own fig tree, <br> and no one will make them afraid, <br> for the Lord Almighty has spoken. <br> All the nations may walk <br> in the name of their gods, <br> but we will walk in the name of the Lord <br> our God for ever and ever.

There is a bench under a tree in the cemetery across the street from my apartment where I go to sit in God’s presence, to receive rest and peace. This fall, I watched the leaves turn from emerald green to golden yellow and burnt orange, before dropping gently to the ground. Flocks of birds often rush overhead and settle in the branches.

As I’ve sought to understand better what it means to feel God’s presence this fall, my spiritual director asked me where God is when I am in the cemetery.

I imagine God holding it all together – the blue sky and drifting clouds, pine trees in the distance, birds calling to one another as they soar. God is the fabric wrapped around it all, keeping it, protecting it.

Micah envisions a world where everyone will sit under their own vine and their own fig tree, and this is what I imagine. A place where each of us feels safe, where God’s sustaining love for the world is clear as day.

This is the peace that awaits us forever and ever in eternity.
But peace is not only a far-off hope; peace is an attribute of God we are called to embody here and now.

On the night of Jesus’ birth, the angels declared peace on earth, goodwill toward humanity. Their declaration lit up the sky on a night unlike any other as God took his first breath in the world he created – but that baby boy grew into a man who was nailed to a cross and pierced by a spear.
We rejected the way of peace, and we do so again and again.

This year, perhaps more than any other I have lived through, we’ve seen how many of our brothers and sisters do not have a place they feel safe in the world. Systemic racism has chained our neighbors to lives of social and economic injustice, and we have been the jailers all too often, holding the keys in our pocket and wielding our swords and spears in fear. We have turned a blind eye to violence perpetrated in ways both subtle and overt.

Micah imagines a world where we beat our swords and our spears into plowshares, tools for breaking up the hard earth and tilling the soil so new life can grow.
Would we be brave enough to do this?

Would we leave our places of safety, lay down our weapons, and commit to learning war no more?
In the ultimate act of nonviolence, our savior became one with the disempowered and suffering and refused to do harm to his enemies. He laid down his life, and death was no more. In his resurrected body, he came to stand among his disciples in their locked and barred room, declaring over their fears, “Peace be with you.”

Peace is ours to become as we walk in the way of our God.

Peace is ours to transform our war-torn world.

Christ himself is our peace, now and forever.

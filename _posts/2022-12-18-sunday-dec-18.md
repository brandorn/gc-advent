scripture_passage: The spirit of the Lord God is upon me,<br>because the Lord has anointed me&#59;<br>he has sent me to bring good news to the oppressed,<br>to bind up the brokenhearted,<br>to proclaim liberty to the captives,<br>and release to the prisoners&#59;<br>to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor,<br>and the day of vengeance of our God&#59;<br>to comfort all who mourn&#59;<br>to provide for those who mourn in Zionâ€”<br>to give them a garland instead of ashes,<br>the oil of gladness instead of mourning,<br>the mantle of praise instead of a faint spirit.<br>They will be called oaks of righteousness,<br>the planting of the Lord, to display his glory.<br>They shall build up the ancient ruins,<br>they shall raise up the former devastations&#59;<br>they shall repair the ruined cities,<br>the devastations of many generations.<br><br>Strangers shall stand and feed your flocks,<br>foreigners shall till your land and dress your vines;<br>but you shall be called priests of the Lord,<br>you shall be named ministers of our God&#59;<br>you shall enjoy the wealth of the nations,<br>and in their riches you shall glory.<br>Because their shame was double,<br>and dishonor was proclaimed as their lot,<br>therefore they shall possess a double portion&#59;<br>everlasting joy shall be theirs.<br><br>For I the Lord love justice,<br>I hate robbery and wrongdoing&#59;<br>I will faithfully give them their recompense,<br>and I will make an everlasting covenant with them.<br>Their descendants shall be known among the nations,<br>and their offspring among the peoples&#59;<br>all who see them shall acknowledge<br>that they are a people whom the Lord has blessed.<br>I will greatly rejoice in the Lord,<br>my whole being shall exult in my God&#59;<br>for he has clothed me with the garments of salvation,<br>he has covered me with the robe of righteousness,<br>as a bridegroom decks himself with a garland,<br>and as a bride adorns herself with her jewels.<br>For as the earth brings forth its shoots,<br>and as a garden causes what is sown in it to spring up,<br>so the Lord God will cause righteousness and praise<br>to spring up before all the nations.

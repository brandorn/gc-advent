scripture_passage: In the time of King Herod, after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, wise men from the East came to Jerusalem, asking, “Where is the child who has been born king of the Jews? For we observed his star at its rising, and have come to pay him homage.” When King Herod heard this, he was frightened, and all Jerusalem with him&#59; and calling together all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Messiah was to be born.<br><br>They told him, “In Bethlehem of Judea&#59; for so it has been written by the prophet&#58;<br>‘And you, Bethlehem, in the land of Judah,<br>are by no means least among the rulers of Judah&#59;<br>for from you shall come a ruler<br>who is to shepherd my people Israel.’”<br><br>Then Herod secretly called for the wise men and learned from them the exact time when the star had appeared. Then he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, “Go and search diligently for the child&#59; and when you have found him, bring me word so that I may also go and pay him homage.” When they had heard the king, they set out&#59; and there, ahead of them, went the star that they had seen at its rising, until it stopped over the place where the child was. When they saw that the star had stopped, they were overwhelmed with joy. On entering the house, they saw the child with Mary his mother&#59; and they knelt down and paid him homage. Then, opening their treasure chests, they offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.<br><br>And having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they left for their own country by another road.

My childhood best friend, Laura, can best be described as a <i>dreamer</i>. She loves to travel, believes in love at first sight, and talks about the future with a twinkle in her eye. She always promises that this next year will be <i>the best one yet</i>.

When I decided to study abroad in Scotland, Laura began planning a trip to visit me. Laura was always planning trips, several of which never came to fruition. But, for Scotland, she saved up money, created a detailed itinerary, and made it all the way across the ocean! When she arrived at the airport, I could barely believe it. We jumped up and down rejoicing, then spent the week sipping tea, climbing castles, and laughing our butts off. It was <i>the best trip yet</i>.

When I think of the wise men visiting Jesus, I am reminded of Laura’s trip to Scotland and her steadfast commitment to following a dream. We don’t know much about the mysterious magi. But we do know they sure can follow a star! Their years of staring up at the stars brought them to the dwelling place of Jesus, the child they would worship.Their hours spent interpreting dreams kept both themselves and young Jesus safe from the wrath of King Herod.

The magi remembered the fear in King Herod’s voice and the power hungry look in his eyes. Then, they looked at the child and decided to dream of what a kingdom led by a shepherd-king might look like. And they took a different way home, knowing the risk that decision carried.

“<i>There is a defiance in being a dreamer<i/>,” author V.E. Schwab writes.

On the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit comes upon the believers, Peter quotes the prophet Joel and tells the crowd:

<blockquote><p>‘In the last days it will be, God declares,<br>
that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh,<br>
and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,<br>
and your young men shall see visions,<br>
and your old men shall dream dreams.<br>
Even upon my slaves, both men and women,<br>
in those days I will pour out my Spirit;<br>
and they shall prophesy.</p></blockquote>
 
These days are here. Christ the shepherd king is with us and the Spirit of the Lord is upon us. 

<b><i>What is a dream God has planted in you?</b></i>

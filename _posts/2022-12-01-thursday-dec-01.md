scripture_passage: That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. Such great crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat there, while the whole crowd stood on the beach. And he told them many things in parables, saying&#58 “Listen! A sower went out to sow. And as he sowed, some seeds fell on a path, and the birds came and ate them up. Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and they sprang up quickly, since they had no depth of soil. But when the sun rose, they were scorched, and since they had no root, they withered away. Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. Other seeds fell on good soil and brought forth grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. If you have ears, hear!”<br><br>“Hear, then, the parable of the sower. When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what is sown in the heart&#59 this is what was sown on the path. As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, yet such a person has no root but endures only for a while, and when trouble or persecution arises on account of the word, that person immediately falls away. As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of this age and the lure of wealth choke the word, and it yields nothing. But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it, who indeed bears fruit and yields in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty.”

In this season of preparation, let us take note of the health of our soil, our soul.

We could ask ourselves:

<ul>
	<li><p>When is the last time we have checked in on our soils/souls?</p></li>
	<li><p>Have we focused our attention elsewhere, as the growing season tailed off?</p></li>
	<li><p>Have the weeds grown up, and the world crept in?</p></li>
</ul>

Maybe some of us are realizing we have not stopped to think much about the state of our souls.

This season of Advent leads us to a blessing that we are not responsible for securing. During a holiday season where so much responsibility falls on us, receiving that gift is a blessing in itself.

Yet as the parable of the Sower illustrates, whether or not this blessing takes root in our lives and whether it grows and produces fruit is a matter of our condition. Is our soul ready to receive this blessing? Is our soil prepared for this blessing?

I wonder if we can take time today to toil a bit in our soil, and help clear space in our souls to receive the blessing of the Lord. Will you follow along in this practice with me?

<ol>
	<li><p>Find a comfortable, quiet place to sit.</p></li>
	<li><p>Close your eyes.</p></li>
	<li><p>Notice your breath, through your nose and out your mouth.</p></li>
	<li><p>Don’t control it, just observe it.</p></li>
	<li><p>As you inhale, think or whisper <i>“Abba.”</i></p></li>
	<li><p>As you exhale, think or whisper <i>“Father.”</i></p></li>
	<li><p>Our minds might wander. If so, try to refocus on that <i>“Abba, Father”</i> breath rhythm.</p></li>
	<li><p>When you feel ready, open your eyes.</p></li>
</ol>

Jesus begins and ends his exhortation of the people in Matthew 13:1-9 with the word, “Listen”. Listen, that we may receive. In small pockets of silence and pause, we clear the space in our souls to practice the presence of God. We listen for our Creator.

As we go about our day, I hope we might carve out small spaces to stop and listen. Here are some ideas:

<ul>
	<li><p>Turn off Spotify in the car.</p></li>
	<li><p>Linger an extra moment in the store.</p></li>
	<li><p>Close your inbox and take a moment to close your eyes.</p></li>
	<li><p>Focus on an element of creation.</p></li>
</ul>

Even if only for a few seconds, take a breath, pause, and listen. Before we go to sleep, maybe we can pray a simple prayer:

<i>Lord Jesus Christ, Son of God, have mercy on us.<br>
You give whether we are ready to receive or not.<br>
You offer us your gift before we understand it.<br>
You sow lavishly, even when we prefer the world to your Kingdom.<br>
Help us hear you.<br>
Help us know the possibilities and promise you hold for our lives.<br>
Lord help our unbelief.<br>
In your name.<br>
So be it.</i>

scripture_passage: In those days Mary arose and went with haste into the hill country, to a town in Judah, and she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. And when Elizabeth heard the greeting of Mary, the baby leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit, and she exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb! And why is this granted to me that the mother of my Lord should come to me? For behold, when the sound of your greeting came to my ears, the baby in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her from the Lord.”

Have you ever leapt for joy? 

My grandmother was always delighted to see my cousins and me literally leaping for joy in our uncontained excitement—jumping up and down, hands flapping, giggles erupting. It didn’t take much back then to prompt our joy, the music of the ice cream truck approaching, the promise of a trip to the community swimming pool, birthday parties on the horizon, trick or treating, and on and on. As I look back, I remember countless moments to celebrate, and the excitement was always contagious.

We see how joy jumps and leaps from person to person in today’s passage. The spread of joy is unstoppable.

The joy I shared with my cousins pales in comparison to the profound joy of Elizabeth and baby John in her womb when they recognize Jesus. Recognizing Jesus. Both Elizabeth and baby John recognized Jesus immediately, prompted by Mary’s greeting as she entered the house. The same joy that comes with recognizing Jesus is available to us as well, through and with the Holy Spirit.

Can you recall the first time that you recognized Jesus? Where were you? With whom? Was it more of an outward or inner experience? Was it a new approach to seeing and experiencing creation in everyday things? 

Someone once told me that we bring God to everyone we meet, and everyone we meet brings God to us. When we recognize Jesus in us and all around us, we become truly rooted in joy, real joy, the all-consuming joy that filled an unborn child as he recognized for the first time the Savior of the World. 

Everything changes.

Immanuel.

scripture_passage: And Mary said&#58; <br> <br> “My soul glorifies the Lord <br>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, <br> for he has been mindful <br>of the humble state of his servant. <br> From now on all generations will call me blessed, <br> for the Mighty One has done great things for me— <br>holy is his name. <br> His mercy extends to those who fear him, <br> from generation to generation. <br> He has performed mighty deeds with his arm&#59; <br> he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. <br> He has brought down rulers from their thrones <br> but has lifted up the humble. <br> He has filled the hungry with good things <br> but has sent the rich away empty. <br> He has helped his servant Israel, <br> remembering to be merciful <br> to Abraham and his descendants forever, <br> just as he promised our ancestors.”

scripture_passage: You who live in the shelter of the Most High, <br> who abide in the shadow of the Almighty, <br> will say to the Lord, “My refuge and my fortress&#59; <br> my God, in whom I trust.” <br> For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler <br> and from the deadly pestilence&#59; <br> he will cover you with his pinions, <br> and under his wings you will find refuge&#59; <br> his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. <br> You will not fear the terror of the night, <br> or the arrow that flies by day, <br> or the pestilence that stalks in darkness, <br> or the destruction that wastes at noonday.

The first time I remember reading the words of Psalm 91 I was in Honduras at the beginning of a yearlong mission trip. My team and I were staying in an old, rundown building outside the city limits of Honduras’s capital. A few days into our stay a storm swept through the country. The building’s roof was no match for the wind and rain, and rivers formed throughout the building’s interior drenching everything in its path. 

The solution for shelter was to go out into the storm and put up tents. My tiny, one-person tent had only been opened a few times since I purchased it, and it definitely hadn’t been tested against rain and wind. I had little faith that it would keep me dry in the conditions.

Thankfully, I managed to get the tent set up. That night as I sat in my tent praying the flimsy fabric was as waterproof as the man at REI had assured me, I began to feel fear around the possibilities of what could happen if I tried to sleep. Having spent a good 30 minutes overthinking, I finally pulled out my flashlight and opened my Bible. After searching for a bit, I landed on Psalm 91, this kind reminder of God’s presence in the moments of fear.

Some scholars think this psalm was originally written as a testimony of someone who sought refuge in the Temple. Whatever its origin, these verses created a refuge for a scared 22-year-old whose overthinking had shifted into overdrive that night in Honduras.

God is our refuge, our shelter, our dwelling place. This encompasses more than just a reference to where someone lives. To find refuge and dwell feels like a long, deep breath, like I am invited to snuggle up in a large, comfy chair by the fire, and exhale the fears that have been weighing me down. The words of Psalm 91 became my dwelling place that night. There was no comfy chair or warm fire, but there was a dry tent and the reminder that I could rest in the presence of God.

Though several years have passed, I never read these verses without thinking about that night. May this be our prayer when we fear the terror of the night, when we are in a season of anticipation, and when the darkness feels like it will overcome.

*Lord, you are my refuge and my fortress. I trust you.*

scripture_passage: The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. <br> He makes me lie down in green pastures&#59; <br> he leads me beside still waters&#59; <br> he restores my soul. <br> He leads me in right paths <br> for his name’s sake. <br> <br> Even though I walk through the darkest valley, <br> I fear no evil&#59; <br> for you are with me&#59; <br> your rod and your staff— <br> they comfort me. <br> <br> You prepare a table before me <br> in the presence of my enemies&#59; <br> you anoint my head with oil&#59; <br> my cup overflows. <br> Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me <br> all the days of my life, <br> and I shall dwell in the house of the Lord <br> my whole life long.

When you study drawing or painting, you learn about light sources. The light source colors all forms and directs all shadows.
Once in college, a drawing professor assigned our class to create a value drawing in charcoal, outside at night. I wasn’t too fond of the idea since it was in the middle of winter. I assumed I would also end up with an uninteresting and very dark drawing. I bundled up, begrudgingly left the warmth of my apartment, and sat on the cold ground with my large drawing board.

Even in the darkness of that winter night a source of light was available to me. In this case I had two: a streetlamp and moonlight. These light sources were just enough to make the tops and sides of trees, hills and buildings visible. Although the completed drawing was still overwhelmingly dark, you could make out the subject matter.

When we trudge through the shadows, we seek a source of light. At times we can’t see our own hands in front of our faces because the darkness is so thick. In those moments we still understand that light exists and that we need it in order to find our way. Would we give the light as much thought in a beautiful, sunny landscape?

In my life’s darkest moments, I have most strongly felt God’s presence. This experience is not unique to me. As I mature in my Christian faith I am thankful that I more instinctively look for God as I walk through the dark valleys. As I look for the Light of the world, I encounter the Prince of Peace.

Meditating on Psalm 23 reminds me how nourishing it is to be meeting again with the Gathering Church family. Sensing or imagining God’s “rod and staff” (and the comfort that comes with them) is harder without in-person scripture readings, praise songs and a sermon once a week. God as a shepherd—what a potent image and metaphor. I’d like to think I don’t need a shepherd, a guide in day-to-day life, but I do. I’m not an anxious person, but I’ve experienced some anxious days in the past year or two. I attribute these waves of anxiety to job-related uncertainty, over-scheduling my days (a coping mechanism perhaps—no time to worry if you’re doing things), the virus, politics, and the sadness of not being able to share Enoch (born May of 2020) with my extended family and church family as much as I’d like. Trying to rationalize or manage all that stress is not easy. So yes, I need a guide to those green pastures and still waters—a shepherd, God.

The “host” imagery in Psalm 23 stands out to me, especially the line “preparing a table”—yes! We are starting to prepare tables again. Sitting down for a meal with Gathering Church friends this past October at the fall party nourished me. I’m looking forward to more of those meals. Being present with each other provides great comfort. Connections are discovered. Experiences are shared.
Dwelling in the house of the Lord together again is good. Let’s meditate on the powerful and calming role God can play as a shepherd and guide in our lives.

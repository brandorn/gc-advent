scripture_passage: Praise be to the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! In his great mercy he has given us new birth into a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, and into an inheritance that can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you, who through faith are shielded by God’s power until the coming of the salvation that is ready to be revealed in the last time. In all this you greatly rejoice, though now for a little while you may have had to suffer grief in all kinds of trials. These have come so that the proven genuineness of your faith—of greater worth than gold, which perishes even though refined by fire—may result in praise, glory and honor when Jesus Christ is revealed. Though you have not seen him, you love him&#59; and even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and are filled with an inexpressible and glorious joy, for you are receiving the end result of your faith, the salvation of your souls.

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-h.svg"><span>H</span>ow can we practice joy during this tumultuous time of a contagious disease, political discord, and personal challenges, be they financial, relational, or otherwise? Sometimes it feels like we are ‘on our own’ now. We can rationally say that we have Joy (capital “J”) because of our faith in God, but we find it difficult to find joy (lower case “j’) because of our circumstances. Scholars might say that Joy is from God because of our salvation and knowledge of the living hope, and joy (or happiness) is from our circumstances. That may be true. But 1 Peter 1:6 tells us that, “There is wonderful joy ahead, even though you must endure many trials for a little while” (NLT). So as Christians, we must hold on to the truth of scripture even though we may not feel it.</p>

I think it helps to add a little joy to our circumstances, even small gestures. For me, it was taking a walk in the quiet forest where gold and red leaves fluttered down and then quietly rested on the path and forest floor. At times, the leaves obscured the obvious trail, and I had to scan ahead for hints of which direction to go. It reminded me of Psalm 119:105: “Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path.” Scripture can help us look right in front of us to avoid stumbles (our trials now), but Scripture also helps us look ahead, down the path, to more joyful times.

How might you add a little joy to your life today?

And how might you bring a little joy to someone else’s life as well?

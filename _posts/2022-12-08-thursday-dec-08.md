scripture_passage: Because of this, I am kneeling down before the father, the one who gives the name of ‘family’ to every family that there is, in heaven and on earth. My prayer is this&#58; that he will lay out all the riches of his glory to give you strength and power, through his spirit, in your inner being&#59; that the king may make his home in your hearts, through faith&#59; that love may be your root, your firm foundation&#59; and that you may be strong enough (with all God’s holy ones) to grasp the breadth and length and height and depth, and to know the king’s love – though actually it’s so deep that nobody can really know it! So may God fill you with all his fullness.<br×br>So&#58; to the one who is capable of doing far, far more than we can ask or imagine, granted the power which is working in us – to him be glory, in the church, and in King Jesus, to all generations, and to the ages of ages! Amen!

Reading Ephesians with <i>rootedness,</i> in mind, I’m struck by how prevalent the theme of <i>kingship</i> is in this letter. I typically don’t associate thrones and roots with one another. 

Yet the word “king” shows up in reference to Jesus at least <b>27 times<b/> in the first three chapters of Ephesians, including <b>three times<b/> in Paul’s prayer for the church in Ephesians 3:14-21. 

So what does Jesus’s kingship have to do with _our_ being rooted and established in love? Why does it matter <i>so much</i> that Jesus is king? 

<b><i>Jesus’s attributes as King reveal the attributes of his Kingdom</i></b>. From his birth in a stable to his scandalous death on a cross, Jesus went about inaugurating God’s kingdom in ways that weren’t “kingly.” Think about it:

<ul>
	<li><p>Where monarchs are typically haughty, Jesus washed his disciples’ feet.</p></li>
	<li><p>While monarchs are often exclusive, Jesus dined with tax collectors and sinners.</p></li>
	<li><p>While monarchs bend their worlds to their will, Jesus prayed, “Not my will, but yours be done.”</p></li>
	<li><p>While monarchs often dictate, legislate, judge, and arbitrate from a distance, Jesus questioned, parabled, befriended, healed, forgave, and prayed right up close.</p></li>
	<li><p>While monarchs secure their thrones through conquest, fighting to conquer their enemies, Jesus secured his place at God’s right hand through submission, laying down his life for his enemies.</p></li>
</ul>

<b><i>Because Jesus is king, we are family</i></b>. In crowning Jesus King, God has made <i>a new people</i>, a new citizenry – and <i>everyone</i> is invited. There is now no separation, no barrier that divides us and makes us enemies (Eph. 2:14). In Jesus, God “gives the name of ‘family’ to every family that there is, in heaven and on earth” (Eph. 3:15). In other words, in crowning Jesus king, God healed our relationships so that we can love one another.

<b><i>It takes all of us – together – to begin to grasp and enact God’s unfathomable love</i></b>. The second-person pronouns in Paul’s prayer are plural – he’s praying his hope for the <i>whole</i> church in a letter that would have been read aloud to groups of believers. In Eph. 1:23, it’s the collective church that is his body. God fills us, all of us, with all the fullness of God’s love (Eph. 3:17-19). This is mysterious, but it seems as though it will take all of us, striving to do life together, to begin to “grasp the breadth and length and height and depth” of the king’s love.

<b><i>Jesus’s love is more than sentiment; it’s sacrificial</i></b>. We live in a culture that idolizes the idea of love, right up until anything much is required of us. Like the man forgiven a debt who then throws his own debtor in prison, we thank Jesus for laying down His life while refusing to lay down our arms. But make no mistake – Jesus’ kingdom charter is written in His blood, and His throne is shaped like the cross. To grow in Christ-likeness while being rooted and established in love means being imitators of God, people who leave cross-shaped impressions on the world around us. 

<b><i>Because Jesus is king, we know love wins</i></b>. When we live and love like Jesus, we are doing more than just emulating our King and crossing our fingers that the risks will be worth it. We are quite literally drawing on the wellspring of strength and power that was “at work in the king when God raised him from the dead and sat him at his right hand in the heavenly places” (Eph. 1:20). Loving like that, we unleash more of God’s resurrection power in our world even as we await the glorious day when God “will make all the sad things come untrue” (<i>The Jesus Storybook Bible</i>, “A Dream of Heaven: Revelation”).

So come, King Jesus. Come, and may your love be our root and our firm foundation!

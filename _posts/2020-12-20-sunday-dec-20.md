scripture: Luke 2:15—20
scripture_passage: When the angels had left them and gone into heaven, the shepherds said to one another, “Let’s go to Bethlehem and see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about.” <br> <br> So they hurried off and found Mary and Joseph, and the baby, who was lying in the manger. When they had seen him, they spread the word concerning what had been told them about this child, and all who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds said to them. But Mary treasured up all these things and pondered them in her heart. The shepherds returned, glorifying and praising God for all the things they had heard and seen, which were just as they had been told.

If love can be accepted, it can also be rejected. If love can be given, it can also be withheld. God has given us abundant love and empowered us to remain in this love. Our passages and reflections this week will encourage you to stay open to the giving and receiving of love. Love is not a one-time decision but a lifetime of dwelling in community with God and others. Choosing to live in love requires courage. Do not be afraid to choose love this week, even if it’s not easy.

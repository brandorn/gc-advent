scripture_passage: In those days Mary set out and went with haste to a Judean town in the hill country, where she entered the house of Zechariah and greeted Elizabeth. When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the child leaped in her womb. And Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit and exclaimed with a loud cry, “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the fruit of your womb. And why has this happened to me, that the mother of my Lord comes to me? For as soon as I heard the sound of your greeting, the child in my womb leaped for joy. And blessed is she who believed that there would be a fulfillment of what was spoken to her by the Lord.”

Our passage today is so full. I can’t help but feel the emotions running so high.  Mary <i>runs</i> to her kin and her friend, Elizabeth, to find comfort and understanding amidst the fear and the unknown.  Elizabeth, attuned to God’s work inside her and amongst her, is filled with anticipation, thanksgiving, and the weight and senselessness of it all. She waits with uncertainty as she feels her baby kicking and filling the room with joy, promise, and the Spirit.

It sounds so disconcerting, doesn’t it? Yet, even Elizabeth shouts her blessing loudly to Mary! There is little about this announcement, this story, this turn of events that reflects the kind of unfettered, undisturbed joy that we sometimes consider when we think of joy. Things don’t add up. Things don’t make sense. And the future, well, it is so very mysterious.  

I have fond memories of dancing and leaping with joy. Even though I am not good at it, it inspires me.  The movement and the music and those around me make for lots of smiles.  When I was a teen, I was on a dance team. Choreography helps someone like me. When I was in college, we went to clubs to dance. Music was too loud, and now I can’t believe I went, but we did.  And it was fun. There was a fall party for optometry students that I went to with my roommates in 1982 where I danced my first dance with my now husband that night, speakers playing, “Start spreadin’ the news.”

I twirled and whirled with my own kids growing up. We used to, “put your whole selves in, put your whole selves out, do the hokey pokey and turn yourself about,” and we laughed and laughed. I danced with my boys at their weddings, spinning around to “And I think to myself, what a wonderful world,”  and “It’s always better when we’re together,” trying to come up with a song to say, "I am full of joy today and I love you.” I have had the true gift of watching my granddaughter twirl and dance with her daddy, my son. It really doesn’t get much more special than that. Joy brings tears sometimes and tears flow easily these days.  

I’m not good at dancing and leaping and moving around, but I do like it.  It feels like something joyful in the midst of life which at times is very hard and very scary and very hard to understand.

Which makes me ask, where does joy fit into this story? Mary’s encounter with Elizabeth and the one before with the angel sound both disconcerting and frightening to me. And yet here we are in this little house, the Spirit is moving, and the baby is leaping amidst all the unknowns. Elizabeth is blessing Mary for her willingness, and Mary is acting, putting one foot in front of the other. Mary responds to God,  “Please Lord, use me. I am your servant.”  

I think that this thing called joy is all tied up in letting go and surrendering our own plans. For some of us, letting go is very scary. It looks a bit chaotic. It looks like the unknown. And yet, we are asked to participate in the work of the Holy Spirit. Of course, letting go is hard work. But perhaps, if we are doing that, the joy is there amidst all the questions and in unexpected places.  

Jesus did come to a groaning world. The promises were being fulfilled. And later in the story, the angels continue to calm our nerves, saying, “Fear not. Do not be afraid. For I bring you good tidings of great joy which will be to all peoples.”

“And the baby leaped in her womb” that day, long ago. Still today, we find moments of joy all around us. Joys fulfilled, joys promised, and the joy amongst us. May we surrender to it and wait for it and maybe even dance and leap while we are waiting.

<b>What is one song that brings you joy, and maybe even makes you want to dance?</b>

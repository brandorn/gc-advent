scripture_passage: “Do not judge, and you will not be judged&#59; do not condemn, and you will not be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven&#59; give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together, running over, will be put into your lap&#59; for the measure you give will be the measure you get back.”<br>He also told them a parable&#58; “Can a blind person guide a blind person? Will not both fall into a pit? A disciple is not above the teacher, but everyone who is fully qualified will be like the teacher. Why do you see the speck in your neighbor's eye, but do not notice the log in your own eye? Or how can you say to your neighbor, ‘Friend, let me take out the speck in your eye,’ when you yourself do not see the log in your own eye? You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your neighbor's eye.

Our elementary school bus squeaked to a halt at a stop sign in front of Kimmy Green’s (not her real name!) house every day. We piled on and off the bus from that same spot each morning and afternoon. My house was only three houses down from Kimmy’s house, so I enjoyed short, solo walks home. Normally, I loved everything about walking home. My walks felt like stolen moments of peace and self-forgetfulness.

But I remember one walk home from that bus stop like it happened yesterday. I was walking home like I always did. Within a second, I found myself abruptly on the ground. My arms splayed out, my lungs couldn’t find a breath, and my metal lunchbox flew forward. Someone had shoved me, hard, and knocked me down from behind.

I looked up. It was Kimmy. <i>“Kimmy? We’re supposed to be friends!”</i> I thought to myself. We visited each other’s Vacation Bible Schools and joined choir practice at Kimmy’s church. Sometimes Kimmy would even invite me over when her mom was making homemade biscuits. At our house, we just popped them out of a can.

<i>“Kimmy what are you doing?”</i> I heard myself turn and confront her. <i>“We are Christians. Christians aren’t supposed to do this, especially not to one another. What have I done to you?”</i>

She couldn’t answer.

<i>“I’m not going to fight you, Kimmy.”</i> I finished. Then, I turned and walked home.

Luke 6:37 (MSG) says this about bullying: “Don’t pick on people.” That’s it. That’s all Kimmy gets, one-third of a verse!

But as for me, Jesus had a lot more to say:

“It’s easy to see a smudge on your neighbor’s face and be oblivious to the ugly sneer on your own. Do you have the nerve to say, ‘Let me wash your face for you,’ when your own face is distorted by contempt? It’s this I-know-better-than-you mentality again, playing a holier-than-thou part instead of just living your own part. Wipe that ugly sneer off your own face and you might be fit to offer a washcloth to your neighbor” (6:41-42, MSG)

After <i>the incident</i>, I began to ruminate on my own exquisite righteousness. My audience of one applauded and patted me vigorously on the back. I let my joyful self-forgetfulness get knocked out of me. Instead, I filled myself instead with something ugly. I pointed my finger at Kimmy in the privacy of my thoughts and enjoyed sharing how I had taken the moral high ground. 

But, gratefully, the Holy Spirit worked on me as time passed. By middle school, something changed. I became unusually protective of Kimmy Greene. I could hardly stand for someone to disparage her. It seemed as if she would not be able to recover from the reputation she was only partially earning.

I don’t know why Kimmy needed someone to fight, but I began to feel like she had her reasons. Rather than focusing on my own self-righteousness, I wished I would have redirected my thoughts.

You may not need one, but if you do, you can borrow my washcloth. It’s really dirty and embarrassing. But it’s the only one I have.

scripture_passage: The Lord is my shepherd. <br> I lack nothing. <br> He lets me rest in grassy meadows&#59; <br> he leads me to restful waters; <br> he keeps me alive. <br> He guides me in proper paths <br> for the sake of his good name. <br> <br> Even when I walk through the darkest valley, <br> I fear no danger because you are with me. <br> Your rod and your staff— <br> they protect me. <br> <br> You set a table for me <br> right in front of my enemies. <br> You bathe my head in oil&#59; <br> my cup is so full it spills over! <br> Yes, goodness and faithful love <br> will pursue me all the days of my life, <br> and I will live in the Lord’s house <br> as long as I live.

scripture_passage: How beautiful upon the mountains <br> are the feet of a messenger <br> who proclaims peace, <br> who brings good news, <br> who proclaims salvation, <br> who says to Zion, “Your God rules!” <br> Listen! Your lookouts lift their voice; <br> they sing out together! <br> Right before their eyes they see the Lord returning to Zion. <br> <br> Break into song together, you ruins of Jerusalem! <br> The Lord has comforted his people and has redeemed Jerusalem. <br> The Lord has bared his holy arm in view of all the nations; <br> all the ends of the earth have seen our God’s victory.

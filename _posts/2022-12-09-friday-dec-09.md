scripture: John 1.1-14
scripture_passage: In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through him, and without him not one thing came into being. What has come into being in him was life, and the life was the light of all people. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not overcome it.<br><br>There was a man sent from God, whose name was John. He came as a witness to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He himself was not the light, but he came to testify to the light. The true light, which enlightens everyone, was coming into the world.<br><br>He was in the world, and the world came into being through him&#59; yet the world did not know him. He came to what was his own, and his own people did not accept him. But to all who received him, who believed in his name, he gave power to become children of God, who were born, not of blood or of the will of the flesh or of the will of man, but of God.<br><br>And the Word became flesh and lived among us, and we have seen his glory, the glory as of a father's only son, full of grace and truth.

The beginning of the Gospel of John presents a fascinating concept: the essence of Jesus, the Word, was with God since the beginning of time. This concept pushes our limits of comprehension. But it's also a comforting thought in ways. The Word, as well as everything that has ever been created or given life, originated from Godâ€”who is full of grace and truth. 

The new life in the Kimbrough household is named Nate. Seeing him start to smile and smirk at us and watching his brothers interact with him brings us great joy. God knew Nate before he was born. When we take a moment to remember this, we have a sense that God is with us as we parent. 

We look forward to our church family getting to know Nate as he grows and changes. We have experienced God's love for our family through all the meals delivered from our brothers and sisters in Christ. As Nate and his older brothers grow we are blessed that they experience God's love through His church. 

Parenting, of course, can be quite daunting. There are ever present questions: are we being patient enough? Are we setting a good example? Are we presenting enough opportunities for the child to develop their gifts? When we, as parents, seek the Light and grow our relationship with God, many of these worries melt away. That's because it becomes obvious that God knows and loves Nate and his brothers. We, as parents, are not alone.

Jesus was with God from the beginning of time, and because of God's love, Jesus became flesh to dwell among us. This season is a time to receive Him once again. We are reminded we are children of God. We belong to God.

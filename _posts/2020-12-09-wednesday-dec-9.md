<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-w.svg"><span>W</span>hat am I yoked with and what drives the cart to which it is attached? As I plow the fields of work and status, with my fellow ox of money/power beside me, I come to find the pride driving me is an unbearably difficult and demanding master. The whip on my back cracks. Pride says to me, “You are better; you can be better; you can work harder; you can succeed at this. Yoked to your dastardly powerful collaborator money/power, you will find security in your own efforts!” Knee-deep in the mud of life, I am pulling, striving, pushing through to yield the pathways where “my” crops of security will grow. Fertilized by my own efforts and that of my collaborator of money/power, these crops will grow. If not, my taskmaster pride will simply strap me and my field partner into the yoke of life once more, and we will awake early in the morning to break up the ground around us and drive the damning blade of my ambition into the ground once more. I do; I can; I will; I am able. I do; I can; I will; I am able.</p>

Then one day, my leg fractures from the weight of the work. Pride keeps whipping my back. My will keeps pushing my other legs forward. My work must go on as I have yoked myself to money/power, and we must yield the crops of security for me and my family. My heart’s deepest part lets out a cry, “I must! If not me, there is no one else ... I must keep striving!!”

Then, I collapse. The yoke, tied to my neck, breaks. Pride’s cart stops because it simply has no more fuel to consume. Failure dissolves the surety of the planned future like the melting of snow when spring’s sun reaches noonday. In this moment of brokenness, I look back and see what all my striving did. Pride and pursuits of power wrought wreckage and fear in those closest to me. The gilded debris of a life of self-reliance shattered in that field, and now the memories of those pursuits reflect the image of me right now: broken, weak, labored and defeated by heavy burdens of my own construction. Breathing is hard. Sadness is permanent. Rage rises. There never was, nor was there ever going to be, peace brought in that field when fear of the future drove my pride to destroy my very soul.

The deepest part of my heart cries out, “I can’t!”

What is pent up within the deepest part of you?  What flows out of your mouth and deeds when pressed by the vice of life, your soul crushed under despair, failure or fear? In that moment of fracture, what flows from your broken alabaster jar? The most wonderful and alluring aroma in the world flows, that which draws Christ right up to you and shows the place where he can rest. Christ’s never ceasing and always forbearing mercy floods to that deepest part and takes your face in his hands and says, “I love you. You are beautifully and wonderfully made. I want you just as you are right now. The aroma of your soul invites me.”

Christ picks my shoulders up, holds my leg to bind it in ever present mercy so the fracture of failure no longer causes a limp of fear but a gait that reflects dependence on my savior. Christ’s gentle and lowly heart moves first to feed that brokenness with mercy. That mercy plants love in my heart. That love provides rest. I find rest by the green pastures this shepherd provides. The streams of eternally flowing mercies nourish me, quench my thirst, and drown pride’s rageful whip. I look up. Rested now, my eyes see Christ.

Christ fashions a yoke first around his neck. I can almost see a twinkle in his eye and remember that there was a time he did say, “It is finished.” He looks at me and smiles. He says, “I am gentle and lowly.” With the yoke around his neck, he invites me to bind my body to his. I say yes. I can rest in his strength, in his sheer power of mercy. I know that from this place, yoked to grace, broken yet healed, the ground need not yield anything from my labor. The field ahead of us no longer brings security and safety to me. The sweet aroma of Christ brings a calmness to the world around me. It is with this aroma, with my gait marked by God’s work, I regain footing in the field of life. The thrashing whip is rolled up. The wake of Christ’s peace now flows over me, and new crops of grace for others grow.

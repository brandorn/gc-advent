Who do you know that reminds you of light? Whose face comes to mind? What about them is light for you? For me, I think about my grandmother. She is joyful and selfless, always goes out of her way to help people or simply offer them a kind word or a smile. Her faith is incredibly important to her, and the light of her faith shines not only in the way she talks but in the way she lives.

I think we see something similar with the life of Christ. He lived with religious leaders who talked about how we are supposed to live, but oftentimes their actions didn’t truly lean into God’s desires. Jesus, on the other hand, came as someone with a message that challenged the way people lived as well as someone that lived into those words. I can imagine that for the people of the time, especially those that lived in darkness, hurt and oppression, Jesus was like a ray of radiant sunshine. Yet Jesus did not live this way all in his own strength. He valued above all his relationship with his father, carved time for this relationship and through it he lived as he did.

The city of Zion is commanded to “arise” and “shine” in this passage. The city will come out of darkness, not because of what the people have done, but because the glory of the Lord will appear over them. From this glory, the city will shine in a way that draws others out of their own darkness and into the light that brings restoration, joy and prosperity. God provides the light, but the people are commanded to take action by arising and shining that light outward.

God is the giver of light, and we’re called to live actively into our faith, to shine. Not only do we pursue God, we also arise daily into God’s goodness and shine light outward in how we live. Without action we can easily fall into the darkness in the world or within our own lives. We can all relate in some way to what darkness feels like in our lives, especially after the past year and a half. Sickness, oppression, racism and tragedy seem ever-present. We know that darkness is present, and at times we can become lost in it, just as the city of Zion struggled with darkness that covered the people. But we have hope. Through the power of Christ, we receive God’s light, and we’re empowered to live out our faith, to shine for others. This can happen in small and big ways that bring transformation to ourselves, our communities, and our world.

The passage ends with a command to lift up our eyes and see all the goodness that God’s light brings. As we head into this season, we are once again reminded to celebrate the arrival of the Light of the world and behold the goodness he brings. We are invited to join in the shining of the light, to arise, to be drawn to the Lord so that we might be part of God’s kingdom on this earth that overcomes darkness.

What is one practical step you can take this week to “arise” into God’s light?

Take a moment to “lift up your eyes” and look about you ... reflect on how God has been working this past year.

<hr>

O Holy One <br>
on mountaintops and valley floors <br>
you reveal to us the light of your love. <br>
Our hearts desire to bask <br>
in the amazing glory of your divine presence. <br>
Encounter us that we may be changed and transformed. <br>
Draw us nearer that we might receive and keep your Holy Spirit. <br>
Help us, O Holy One, to live our lives <br>
as reflections of your divine glory. <br>
May we walk among our brothers and sisters as a blessing, <br>
bearing light into dark places, <br>
hope to displace despair, <br>
and love that casts out hate. <br>
Our world is hurting <br>
and we want to follow you more closely. <br>
Maybe then we will hear your voice speaking to us, saying, <br>
… “listen my Child, the Beloved!” <br>
We pray in the name of the Father, <br>
of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, <br>
Amen.

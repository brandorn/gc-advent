scripture_passage: In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn. <br><br> In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, ‚ÄúDo not be afraid; for see‚ÄîI am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people&#58; to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you&#58; you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.‚Äù And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying, <br><br> ‚ÄúGlory to God in the highest heaven, <br> and on earth peace among those whom he favors!‚Äù

Overwhelming light does not mean all darkness is gone. More often than not, the overwhelming light of God shows up only for a brief moment, like with the shepherds in Luke 2. These powerful occurrences stay with us and change how we see. A sudden, bright light shining in the darkness can be overwhelming to our eyes. Even in its brevity, the light of God can overwhelm our fears and empower us to see everything differently.

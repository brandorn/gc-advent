scripture_passage: Love never ends. But as for prophecies, they will come to an end; as for tongues, they will cease&#59; as for knowledge, it will come to an end. For we know only in part, and we prophesy only in part&#59; but when the complete comes, the partial will come to an end. When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child&#59; when I became an adult, I put an end to childish ways. For now we see in a mirror, dimly, but then we will see face to face. Now I know only in part&#59; then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known.

Seasons of Life <br>
Written by <br>
Two Bedside Tables

Two nightstands with minimal skills of observation would like to report the following tabletop inventories.
Table 1: A small lamp, a coaster picturing two flamingos flying in unison, an earring and necklace stand, a pink retro baby Furby with a little blue tuft of wily hair. Table 1 would like to report that the hair managed to escape a pair of scissors back on the day that one kid said to another, “Let’s play beauty shop.”

Table 2: A large lamp, a push button phone, eye drops, Kleenex, an alarm clock with extra large numbers, a magnifying glass, a Bible, a flashlight. Table 2 would like to say the remote control that usually sits beside the Kleenex is behind the bed because of the cat.
In the first season of life a bedside table has a lamp, or one ‘seeing aid,’ and a lot of fun stuff that’s good because someone fancied it. In a later season of life a bedside table has several seeing aids and stuff that is good because someone knows they need it.
Aging has a way of overshadowing the once effective night vision of our youth, a season when a full moon is still sufficient to take the dog on her evening walk. But it may also be a season when we don’t pause long enough to ponder the things of finitude and infinity and Love’s role in reconciling the two. The overshadowing of our vision seems sad, and in some ways it is. We are constantly losing. Everything slows and cools. There’s a law for it in thermodynamics.

Eternal dynamics, however, rips back the darkest overshadowing that keeps us seeing dimly in this short while. The slowing and cooling into which we are forced is but for a season, and then we will see God fully, just like God sees and knows us. We will know and be known wholly, love and be loved completely!

Today’s passage is a beautiful statement of faith from the Apostle Paul. We are made aware of our spiritual eyes and the incompletion of our sight. But this condition is temporary, and knowing that ‘we need’ is good. We’re given a double invitation to humility and an open door to Jesus who brings what we need. In humility we act and rest in an integral stance of faith that accepts our vague spiritual sight for now. And yet we rejoice while we wait because our incompleteness will give way to the coming of the Lord Jesus! At Advent he comes first to earth as a baby, at Easter, he is the risen Savior and in the final season he will come at the end of the age.
The scripture says we put away the things of childhood, not because they weren’t important in their time but because this is a new time, a time for bright seeing and eternal knowing. Our dim vision yields to faith, hope and love, and the Greatest of These clears the table. He comes to make room for that which we need, the sum of which we can’t live without.

In what ways do you suspect you see dimly with your spiritual eyes? How does the coming promise of complete sight make you feel?
Do you ever feel like you shouldn’t have so many “needs?” What might God like to say to you about that right now?

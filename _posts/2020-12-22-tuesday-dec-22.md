scripture_passage: “Look,” said Naomi, “your sister-in-law is going back to her people and her gods. Go back with her.” <br> <br> But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to leave you or to turn back from you. Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God. Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.” When Naomi realized that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped urging her.

What is love? From where does it come, and how do we recognize it? Can it be a thing of choice or is it an emotion that dictates the direction of your life? Can we choose by act of will to love someone or is it a feeling of deep emotion that causes us to forsake all else? 

The love story in the book of Ruth becomes apparent when Naomi’s loss of her husband and sons causes her to release her daughters-in-law to return to their family homes in Moab. Ruth will not accept this. Her love for Naomi dictates what she must do. She pledges her commitment to Naomi. 

What would create this love-choice? What did Ruth see in Naomi’s life that compelled her to vow to go, to stay, to be her people, to accept her God, to die and to be buried in the same place? Ruth seems fearless in this argument and speaks a curse upon herself: “May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.”

Do not be afraid to choose love.
Even when it’s the hard thing – filled with uncertainty, hardship or heartache – choose love.
It’s okay that we may never know God’s outcome in our lifetime.

Actions speak loudly. Ruth did not fear to choose love.
She did not see that from her Love-choice, the lineage of Christ would come.

Who knows what might come from your love-choice?

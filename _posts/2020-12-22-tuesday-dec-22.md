scripture_passage: Naomi said, “Look, your sister-in-law is returning to her people and to her gods. Turn back after your sister-in-law.” <br> <br> But Ruth replied, “Don’t urge me to abandon you, to turn back from following after you. Wherever you go, I will go&#59; and wherever you stay, I will stay. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. Wherever you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the Lord do this to me and more so if even death separates me from you.” When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she stopped speaking to her about it.

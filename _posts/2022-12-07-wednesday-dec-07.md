scripture_passage: So God created humans in his image,<br>in the image of God he created them&#59;<br>male and female he created them.<br><br>God blessed them, and God said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the air and over every living thing that moves upon the earth.” God said, “See, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is upon the face of all the earth and every tree with seed in its fruit&#59; you shall have them for food. And to every beast of the earth and to every bird of the air and to everything that creeps on the earth, everything that has the breath of life, I have given every green plant for food.” And it was so. God saw everything that he had made, and indeed, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.

Have you ever read the story of <i>The Rainbow Fish</i>? We often read this children's book when I was growing up and admired the beautiful pictures. 

To summarize, the book is about a fish called Rainbow Fish because of his beautiful blue, green, and shiny scales. One day, a little, blue fish swam up to him and asked if he could have just one of the Rainbow Fish's beautiful scales. But the Rainbow Fish was appalled at this request and refused. Suddenly the Rainbow Fish found himself alone — with no one to admire his beauty or care about him.

After finally asking for advice from a wise octopus, something changed. The next time the little blue fish came up to the Rainbow Fish and timidly asked if he could have just one beautiful scale, the Rainbow Fish thought for a moment and agreed to give him just one small, shiny scale. The little blue fish swam around showing off the beautiful scale. Of course, all the other fish then wanted one too.

And you know what? The Rainbow Fish started giving away his scales to all the other fish. "The Rainbow Fish shared his scales left and right. And the more he gave away, the more delighted he became" (<i>The Rainbow Fish</i>, Marcus Pfister, 1992). At the end of the story, we see the Rainbow Fish with only one shiny scale left.  

In Genesis chapter one, we see how God has made humankind in God’s own image. And then God blesses them and gives them a command— to multiply within the earth and to rule over, or govern, the land and the animals. When I think about this responsibility of stewardship of God’s gifts, I think of <i>connection</i>. We steward by being connected with the world and that over which we are ruling or governing. As I wondered what stewarding might look like in the areas of the world that each of our lives touch, I thought of the Rainbow Fish. 

By growing outward into the world and sharing our gifts, talents, and places of impact, we are stewarding well, just like the Rainbow Fish finally shared his scales. Instead of being one beautiful, shiny fish, the ocean became full of his beautiful, shiny scales.

Let us learn each day to root ourselves again and again in the Lord. May we also learn to grow outward, governing over God's creation with the beautiful talents and gifts that God has given each of us, with the reminder that we are all intimately connected.

Jesus is our perfect example of the (transformed) Rainbow Fish. He lived rooted in the Father and yet fully connected with the world around him, stewarding creation and relationships incredibly well. 

<i>What is one of your gifts, talents, or areas of influence that you can share to steward the earth</i>?

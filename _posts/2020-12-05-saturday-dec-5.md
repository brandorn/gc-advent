scripture_passage: Praise the Lord! <br> Because it is good to sing praise to our God! <br> Because it is a pleasure to make beautiful praise! <br> <br> The Lord rebuilds Jerusalem, gathering up Israel’s exiles. <br> God heals the brokenhearted <br> and bandages their wounds. <br> God counts the stars by number, <br> giving each one a name. <br> Our Lord is great and so strong! <br> God’s knowledge can’t be grasped! <br> The Lord helps the poor, <br> but throws the wicked down on the dirt! <br> <br> Sing to the Lord with thanks; <br> sing praises to our God with a lyre! <br> God covers the skies with clouds; <br> God makes rain for the earth; <br> God makes the mountains sprout green grass. <br> God gives food to the animals— <br> even to the baby ravens when they cry out. <br> God doesn’t prize the strength of a horse; <br> God doesn’t treasure the legs of a runner. <br> No. The Lord treasures the people <br> who honor him, <br> the people who wait for his faithful love.

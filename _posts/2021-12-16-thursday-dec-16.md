scripture_passage: In those days a decree went out from Emperor Augustus that all the world should be registered. This was the first registration and was taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria. All went to their own towns to be registered. Joseph also went from the town of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was descended from the house and family of David. He went to be registered with Mary, to whom he was engaged and who was expecting a child. While they were there, the time came for her to deliver her child. And she gave birth to her firstborn son and wrapped him in bands of cloth, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.

Joan Osborne’s debut project "Relish" was nominated for 6 Grammy Awards in 1996 including Song of the Year for "One of Us." Eric Bazilian wrote the lyrics to “One of Us” very quickly one evening to impress a girl.

You may recall the lyrics:

<p>If God had a name what would it be?<br>
And would you call it to his face?<br>
If you were faced with Him in all His glory<br>
<b>What would you ask if you had just one question?</b><br>
And yeah, yeah, God is great<br>
Yeah, yeah, God is good<br>
And yeah, yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah<br>
<b>What if God was one of us?</b><br>
Just a slob like one of us<br>
Just a stranger on the bus<br>
Tryin' to make his way home?</p>

The point of the Christmas story is that God indeed joins our company as one of us and that God does so inconspicuously, humbly. I have found I am more comfortable with the “have-nots” than I am with the “haves.” I don’t want to be poor, but I want to be poor in spirit. There is something about those whose orientation in life is survival that I find affects me deeply. I am attracted to minimalism, simplicity, the earth and sky, clean air and water. I love the atmosphere of a barn where the mowers smell of dry, cut grass. I love the energy of falling waters, the movement of leaves tossed in the breeze. 

God was one of us. Incarnate God stepped in among us as a Jewish, newborn, baby boy, wrapped in warm strips of cloth and the loving, warm arms of his mother Mary. This was the humble beginning of a one-of-a-kind person who would lead a most simple, earthy, inconspicuous life for thirty years. Content to be a carpenter and provide for his family, Jesus breathed the same air we breathe, walked in the same dirt we walk, worked with his hands like we do, focused on family survival like so many are. Then one day, Earthmaker’s voice overpowered the sound of hammer and saw, and the carpenter ventured forth from Nazareth as the Light of the World. The Light of the World had dirty feet, calloused hands, words with weight, a smile to soothe the most troubled mind, arms willing to hold children and a focus on Jerusalem. A humble entry to this world. A tormented conclusion.

So, “What would you ask if you had just one question?”

Today my question is: How can I wrap my head and my heart around this humble kind of incarnation?

scripture_passage: “As the Father has loved me, so have I loved you. Now remain in my love. If you keep my commands, you will remain in my love, just as I have kept my Father’s commands and remain in his love. I have told you this so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may be complete. My command is this&#58; Love each other as I have loved you.”

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-a.svg"><span>A</span>s I have walked in relationship with God this love Jesus speaks of seems to unfold more and more. Over the years when I read “keep my commands” I thought of it as a laundry list of ‘to dos’ to earn God’s love. I would need to muster up love to serve others better. Then, all this pressure to be and do more would choke out any kind of joy and leave me exhausted. Growing up in Sunday school I knew the right answer, “Jesus loves me for the Bible tells me so,” but how this played out in my life, my functional picture of God, was a God who loved me but was disappointed too. Feeling this self-inflicted disappointment, I would push God away. I would distance myself from others too because I was afraid of letting anyone see my failures. It was safer to keep everyone at arm’s length, including God.</p>

I am learning to remain in God’s love. I am opening my hands, turning my face and heart to God and believing his unconditional, never-ceasing, all-encompassing love will penetrate the deepest parts of my soul. I am learning to accept God’s love, hold it, and keep company with God. In this way I am growing in God’s secure love. Love for others naturally pours out. Love not of my own volition or power but from God’s abundance. The glorious overflow of living life with God is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, gentleness, and self-control.

Today, I challenge you to “keep company with Jesus,” as Trevor Hudson puts it. The book of Mark is the shortest gospel. I encourage you to read the entire gospel in one sitting to get the whole picture of Jesus’ life and love for us. What did you notice about Jesus? Is your functional picture of God different from what you read?

Prayer:

<i>God, reveal your love for us in a deeper, clearer way today. May we press into and accept this love with open hands and share this love freely with others. Your arms are always open wide inviting us into this dancing relationship of love with the Trinity. May we be filled with overflowing joy as we prepare for the celebration of the Christ-child, Emmanuel! Amen.</i>

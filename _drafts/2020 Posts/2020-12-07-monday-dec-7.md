scripture_passage: How beautiful on the mountains <br> are the feet of those who bring good news, <br> who proclaim peace, <br> who bring good tidings, <br> who proclaim salvation, <br> who say to Zion, <br> “Your God reigns!” <br> Listen! Your watchmen lift up their voices; <br> together they shout for joy. <br> When the Lord returns to Zion, <br> they will see it with their own eyes. <br> Burst into songs of joy together, <br> you ruins of Jerusalem, <br> for the Lord has comforted his people, <br> he has redeemed Jerusalem. <br> The Lord will lay bare his holy arm <br> in the sight of all the nations, <br> and all the ends of the earth will see <br> the salvation of our God.

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-i.svg"><span>I</span>n their book Mending the Divides: Creative Love in a Conflicted World, Jon Huckins and Jer Swigart share how bringing peace (peacemaking) is to move toward conflict – not just to end fights or resolve tension, but to restore relationships, renovate broken systems, and replace unjust ones altogether.</p>

They suggest that we can do this by remembering 4 simple verbs (see, immerse, contend, and restore): 

1. <p><b>See:</b> We have to understand that we have been conditioned to see/understand certain people and conditioned not to see/understand others; to see issues that affect us and not see (or ignore) issues that don’t affect us. When we talk about seeing, we have to see the humanity, the dignity, the image of God in everyone in every situation, whether it affects us or not, whether we understand it or not. For peacemaking, we need open eyes and empathetic hearts.</p>
2. <p><b>Immerse:</b> Once we have seen the people and places and situations we have been taught not to see/understand, we actually have to move deep into relationships. We have to move into uncommon conversations with people who look and think and feel differently than we do, equipped with tools to heal and transform rather than to win or control. Immersion requires us to move in the posture of learners rather than heroes.</p>
3. <p><b>Contend:</b> To contend is to stand in front of any bulldozer that flattens people. Contending requires that we get creative in love. For Jesus to contend for our restoration, for our flourishing, it didn’t look like military overthrow on the white horse of the Roman empire; it looked like suffering and selflessness and intentional, unconditional love.</p>
4. <p><b>Restore:</b> As we see, immerse, and contend, we begin to take part in God’s work of restoration through and in the most unorthodox people and places. More people in the world feel valued, accepted, protected, respected, comforted, and loved. We’re reminded that God’s work in this world is restoration and that he is inviting us to join in that work.</p>
5. <p><b>Prayer:</b> God, use our lives in the coming year to bring some measure of peace for those who have felt ignored, disliked, undervalued, neglected and rejected. May they feel understood, appreciated, and known because of the ways that you will work through us. May they experience a peace that surpasses their current understanding of how the world works. Thank you God.</p>

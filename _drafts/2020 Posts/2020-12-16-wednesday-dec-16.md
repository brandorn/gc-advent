scripture_passage: After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb. There was a violent earthquake, for an angel of the Lord came down from heaven and, going to the tomb, rolled back the stone and sat on it. His appearance was like lightning, and his clothes were white as snow. The guards were so afraid of him that they shook and became like dead men. The angel said to the women, “Do not be afraid, for I know that you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified. He is not here&#59; he has risen, just as he said. Come and see the place where he lay. Then go quickly and tell his disciples&#58; ‘He has risen from the dead and is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him.’ Now I have told you.” <br> <br> So the women hurried away from the tomb, afraid yet filled with joy, and ran to tell his disciples. Suddenly Jesus met them. “Greetings,” he said. They came to him, clasped his feet and worshiped him. Then Jesus said to them, “Do not be afraid. Go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee&#59; there they will see me.”

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-d.svg"><span>D</span>o not be afraid to practice joy.
Jesus is resurrected.</p>

It’s in my personality to look for the joy in almost everything.
It’s in my personality to hold a lot of internal fear.
 
<i>Experience.</i>  <br>
Version 1) <br>
Good morning kitchen sink. <br>
You greet me with what you hold. <br>
I greet you bleary eyed, a night of crying for my losses, crying for my fears. <br>
Now I am here, cleaning up behind some family member… Oh look. Three little pumpkins sitting on the kitchen table. <br> A line of morning light shines on them. A spotlight, blazing homage to the orange-ness of Fall. <br>
This is joy, to wonder in the quiet what was God thinking when he decided that orange was a good idea? <br>
I ponder. <br>
Ponder is not ruminating. One brings anxiety, the other joy. <br>
Weeping may endure for a night, but orange comes in the morning. I made myself laugh. It leaves a quiet smile. <br>
I am not afraid to practice joy. <br>
 
<i>Experience.</i> <br>
Version 2) <br>
Good morning kitchen sink. <br>
You greet me with what you hold. <br>
I greet you bleary eyed, a night of crying for my losses, crying for my fears. <br>
Now I am here, cleaning up behind some family member… Oh look. Olivia’s wooden spoon. <br>
Mangled in the garbage disposal. Add to the losses. <br>
Three little pumpkins that Roger brought home, shine brightly on the kitchen table. I do not see them. <br>
I grieve. The hands of four generations, stirring, turning, dipping, sipping, resting on the stove. <br>
How many more meals would you have had to give? <br>
This is not joy. <br>
I do not ponder. I ruminate. <br>
I am sorry Franks, Jones, Beale families. <br>
I am sorry to my children’s children, <br>
to their great, great grandmother, <br>
Olivia, who loved me and called me honey. <br>
She was sweet and true. <br>
I am afraid. (It’s really grief.) <br>
I should have been more attentive. <br>
What else am I missing? <br>
I am afraid to practice joy. <br>

<i>Experience.</i> <br>
Version 3) <br>
The first day after the Sabbath. The day is dawning. <br>
Good morning Mary and Mary. <br>
You greet me with what you hold: faithfulness. I need it. <br>
You greet me with your faithfulness to Jesus. I need him. <br>
You greet me bleary eyed, crying for your losses. <br>
You were last at the cross. First at the tomb. <br>
Mary and Mary, you clean up behind us, your family members, deniers, abandoners, ignorers. <br>
I need it. <br>
I ponder. <br>
I repent. <br>
The angel tells you. Do not be afraid. I practice hearing this word for myself and am moved to consider joy. <br>
The angel tells you, He’s not here! He’s been raised! I can’t help it. <br>
I believe! <br>
I see the blaze of resurrection light: God’s way of practicing Joy! <br>
 
Good morning kitchen sink. <br>
The tomb greets me with what it could not hold! <br>
Joy leaves behind what it doesn’t need.
 
Pumpkins and spoons endure for a night; but Joy comes in the morning. <br>
Joy laughs that we laugh, <br>
and builds on itself <br>
and endures.

At Advent we practice joy because it heals the wounds of fear, gives life and endures.
 
The angel tells Mary and Mary do not be afraid in their being. <br>
Jesus tells them do not be afraid in their doing.
 
Question:
Is there a part of you that needs resurrecting through the practice of joy?
 
Exercise:
If so find 2-3 things be in awe of, curious about or to take delight in. Practice letting them hold your attention until the Holy Spirit moves you forward in peace. The underbelly of joy is peace.
 
Prayer:
If you have fear today, would you ask God to replace the fear in your being and fear in your doing with courage to practice Christ’s Joy?

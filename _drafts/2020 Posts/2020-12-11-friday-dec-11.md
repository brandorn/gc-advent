Now Jesus is talking about leaving to go see His Father, then coming back. (What in the world? We’re trying to enjoy a celebration dinner together and NOW He’s talking about leaving to go see His dad?)

Jesus clears up the confusion about his Father, meaning God. His time has come to return to be with God. But before he says, “Father, the hour has come,” Jesus brings peace to his closest friends knowing that their world is about to unravel.

However, Jesus doesn’t jump straight into talking about peace. First Jesus tells us that we’ll experience grief while He’s gone, but we’ll see each other again. Then we’ll rejoice, and no one will take that away.

Jesus tells us of the grief, the loneliness, the hatred, and the pain we will experience. He likens our anguish to a woman giving birth. But He won’t leave us all by ourselves. We’ll have an Advocate here, the Holy Spirit, who will “prove the world to be wrong.”

“I have told you these things, so that in me you may have peace. In this world you will have trouble. But take heart! I have overcome the world.”

Do you listen?

Do you believe what He’s telling you?

Does this bad news give you any comfort or peace?

Why, in an effort to bring peace, was Jesus giving us all this bad news?

Let’s admit something about our human nature: there is a peace that comes with knowing what to expect. We rarely receive this kind of foresight, but Jesus actually gives us that here. Jesus knew that his friends would soon be anguished and downtrodden. But he also knew that the very state of being in anguish would recall this specific conversation and remind them of his promises.

What has the anguish of 2020 brought to your mind?

Do not be afraid to bring peace. We are called to be peacemakers. Peace sounds like an easy message to bring to others. However, the power of the Good News is that it doesn’t ignore suffering or grief. You have to tell the WHOLE story.

2020 is part of THAT story! 

In this season of Advent, reflect and share with others this message of peace … the FULL message. Do not be afraid to include the part about experiencing trouble.

Then take joy in delivering the punchline, that Jesus has overcome the world!

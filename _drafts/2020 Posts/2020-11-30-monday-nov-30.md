scripture: Hebrews 6:13—20
scripture_passage: When God made his promise to Abraham, since there was no one greater for him to swear by, he swore by himself, saying, “I will surely bless you and give you many descendants.” And so after waiting patiently, Abraham received what was promised. <br> <br> People swear by someone greater than themselves, and the oath confirms what is said and puts an end to all argument. Because God wanted to make the unchanging nature of his purpose very clear to the heirs of what was promised, he confirmed it with an oath. God did this so that, by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled to take hold of the hope set before us may be greatly encouraged. We have this hope as an anchor for the soul, firm and secure. It enters the inner sanctuary behind the curtain, where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered on our behalf. He has become a high priest forever, in the order of Melchizedek.

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-a.svg"><span>A</span> thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices / For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn.” “The weary world” — can’t you feel those words deep in your soul this year, in your very bones even? These lyrics of Nathan’s favorite Christmas song, “O Holy Night,” sound like they could have been written just for this long night we’ve lived through together, yet apart, in 2020.</p>

Those apt words also feel reminiscent of what it’s like to bring a child into the world, something our family experienced as part of our 2020. Leila Emmanuelle was born this spring, just as the pandemic began in the US, but we had her name in mind before the year started. “Leila” means “night” and “Emmanuelle” means “God with us,” but we had no idea at the time how uniquely comforting this idea of God’s presence — and the hope that comes with it — would be throughout this strange first year of her life.

Fittingly, Leila was born right at dawn, after a long night of no sleep and exhausting effort that felt like it would never end. When she finally appeared, rejoicing through weariness is exactly how we felt! Through all of the tension, fatigue, and even some fear (her heart rate started to drop for a while), knowing that our daughter awaited us on the other side of the delivery helped us to press on in hope toward the joy of seeing her at last.

Hebrews 6:13-20 is a clear statement of one of the larger themes of that entire book: Jesus Christ has appeared as the perfect fulfillment of God’s promises, bringing with Him the hope of even greater things to come. His incarnation is God swearing by His very self — the undeniable, living and breathing confirmation of His unchangeable word. Jesus is both the Great High Priest who offers up the once-for-all sacrifice that reconciles us to God, and the offering itself, the spotless Lamb who takes away our sin, making it safe and satisfying for us to be in the presence of a holy God.
Again and again in Hebrews, the unknown author exhorts his or her readers to look to this Jesus in hope, even in the midst of difficult circumstances. The author doesn’t deny that these Christians are going through trials but reminds them that there is something better, something lasting, that awaits them. The winds and waves that surround them may continue to frighten and wear them down, but by holding tightly to Jesus, the strong and immovable anchor of their souls, these believers can endure as He did.

The author of Hebrews couldn’t see ahead to the year 2020, but the Holy Spirit writing through them could. Similarly, we can’t perceive what 2021 will hold, but we can trust that Jesus, the One who “is the same yesterday, today, and forever” (Hebrews 13:8), waits for us there. As we continue on in this challenging stretch of the race set before us, our weary souls can find fuel in looking backward to the “new and glorious morn” when Jesus first appeared as confirmation of God’s trustworthiness and in looking forward to that final and most glorious of all mornings (for there will one day be no more night!) when we will see Him at last, our steadfast hope and the great reward of our endurance.

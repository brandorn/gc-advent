<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-o.svg"><span>O</span>ur scripture today is an invitation to worship the One whose birth we celebrate this season.  We are to worship Him with shouts of joy, with gladness, with joyful songs, with thanksgiving and with praise.  We worship because He is God, He made us and we are His, He is good, His love endures forever, and He is faithful – always and forever.</p>

There are so many pre-COVID-19 “normal life” things that I miss.  One of them is watching some of The Gathering children worship together in the right-hand corner of Creekside’s gym.  The children genuinely do not care who is watching.  They sing, twirl, and come before God with gladness and joyful songs.  Oh, if we all could be a bit more child-like.

Karl loves nature and all kinds of creatures.  One afternoon we were walking on the American Tobacco Trail when Karl threw his arms out in front of me, like an umpire calling a runner safe at home base, and whispered, as loudly as one can whisper, “STOP!”  I jumped back thinking that I was about to step on a copperhead and began to question him about what was wrong.  Karl continued to whisper, “Look!  A flock of Cedar Waxwings!”  “What?  You about gave me a heart attack!  What are Cedar Waxwings?”  We stood there for quite some time watching a flock of birds – I mean, Cedar Waxwings – sitting in a tree, singing.  Karl was in a state of awe, but I was thinking – “When can we start walking again?”  Karl always has his nature antenna up; his radar is on.  He instinctively listens for the many different bird songs.  He notices the different types of scat on a trail, the different species of trees, leaves, frogs, snakes, foxes, beavers, etc.  When we take time, watch carefully, and listen, we see the beauty that is hidden to those who are moving too fast to notice.

This Advent and Christmas season is different.  Due to COVID-19 we are not able to celebrate all of our annual traditions like taking our grandchildren to the Nutcracker ballet or hosting neighbors to Christmas Eve dinner.  I encourage all of us to take advantage of the opportunity to set aside some of these “normal” activities/distractions, and let us focus on the real reason for the season: the celebration of the birth of the Christ child.  Stop, take time, watch carefully, listen and soak in the beauty of God’s love for you. 

Joy to the World the Lord is come,<br>
Let earth receive her King<br>
Let every heart prepare Him room<br>
And Heaven and nature sing<br>

<i>Conflicted</i>

It’s coming on Christmas <br>
<i>On your feet now-Applaud God!</i> <br>
They are cutting down trees <br>
<i>Bring a gift of laughter</i> <br>
They are putting up reindeers <br>
<i>Sing yourselves into His presence</i> <br>
And singing songs of joy and peace <br>
<i>Enter with the password: “Thank you”</i> <br>
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on <br>
<i>Make yourselves at home talking praise.</i> <br>
Thank God. Worship God. <br>
<i>For God is sheer beauty. All-generous in love, loyal always and ever.</i>

(“The River” lyrics by Joni Mitchell; Psalm 100, The Message)

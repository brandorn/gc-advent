scripture: Luke 12.22—32
scripture_passage: Then Jesus said to his disciples, “Therefore, I say to you, don’t worry about your life, what you will eat, or about your body, what you will wear. There is more to life than food and more to the body than clothing. Consider the ravens&#58; they neither plant nor harvest, they have no silo or barn, yet God feeds them. You are worth so much more than birds! Who among you by worrying can add a single moment to your life? If you can’t do such a small thing, why worry about the rest? <br> <br> “Notice how the lilies grow. They don’t wear themselves out with work, and they don’t spin cloth. But I say to you that even Solomon in all his splendor wasn’t dressed like one of these. If God dresses grass in the field so beautifully, even though it’s alive today and tomorrow it’s thrown into the furnace, how much more will God do for you, you people of weak faith! Don’t chase after what you will eat and what you will drink. Stop worrying. All the nations of the world long for these things. Your Father knows that you need them. Instead, desire his kingdom and these things will be given to you as well. Don’t be afraid, little flock, because your Father delights in giving you the kingdom.”

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-n.svg"><span>N</span>ow that you’ve read the text, I’m going to ask you to go back and read it again, slowly, (and preferably out loud). And this time, read it being reminded that Jesus isn’t peddling a self-help TED Talk. Jesus, the God-Man, present at creation, the Divine Word, etc., seems to be telling us what the world is really like, what is <i>real</i>—describing the really real reality of our everyday experience. So read it again with that in mind. Go ahead! I’ll wait…</p>

You’re back! What stuck out to you? What resistance did you have?

When I was younger, I used to roll my eyes at Jesus harping on anxiety and worry. Didn’t he have bigger fish to fry? But now … now that I have a young family, financial insecurity, fear of illness of loved-ones, children’s future choices, social and political chaos, all weighing on my mind—suddenly his attunement to our anxious hearts not only makes sense, but reveals his attentiveness to our experience. He knows us. By speaking to our worries, he remembers that we are dust, and he knows how anxiety hollows out our lives and diminishes joy.

So how does he propose we deal with our worries? He calls us to <i>consider</i>. To <i>“think over, perceive, learn from”</i> the everyday world. Ravens and lilies—these fragile, simple lives that, despite having zero control over their circumstances, somehow live and display the glory of God by simply being what they are.

<i>Consider</i> your pet or houseplant.

<i>Ponder</i> the wrens resting in the rafters at Lowes.

<i>Think about</i>  the spiders spinning their silk strung across powerlines.

What do we learn? For one, I see something like a waltz in which God and his critters step together to the music of creation. The spider weaves, the wren gathers, the houseplant reaches. But in each case, the very substances which nourish and support them are things over which they have no control, and as far as I can tell, are oblivious to! They are God’s gifts. The birds at my birdfeeder have no idea from whence the seed comes. It is from beyond them and utterly unintelligible to them. However, in some beautiful causal chain of cosmic affection, God feeds them, even through me. And all they do is flit and feed on it (I hope appreciatively because seed costs money!) and display God’s glory by being what they are. And if God loves them in this way, how much more us, into whose muddy nostrils he breathed his own animating Spirit?

I want to leave you with some words from a new friend of mine, Julian of Norwich, a 14th century Anchoress in England. In a vision, Jesus shows her a “little thing, the quantity of a hazelnut” in the palm of her hand. She marvels at it, wondering what it might be. Jesus tells her “it is all that is made.” Reflecting on this image, she recalls, “I marveled how it might last, for me thought it might suddenly have fallen to nought for littleness.” How could such a small thing be? In response to that question, she heard, <i>“It lasteth and ever shall, for God loveth it. And so hath all things being by the love of God.”</i>
And you. You have your being by the love of God.

Do consider today. Consider the ravens, the lilies, the wrens, the ragweed, the cow, the sea cucumber, the basset hound, the beetle, and the million miniscule things which train our eyes to recognize God’s mysterious goodness. And be ye not afraid to take joy in God’s affection to you in the glass at your lips and the scent on the breeze and the mischief in a friend’s eye. Do not be afraid to take great joy in these, for God is good, and his lovingkindness lasts forever and forever and forever. Amen.

Prayer:

<i>Anxiousless God, all the world is yours, and you hold it in your hand. Help me to know today—to really know your unwavering goodness. Put my worries in their place. Help me to learn from you Jesus how to live in this reality, this kingdom, that I, and all creation with me, might enjoy you forever. Amen.</i>

scripture_passage: Praise the Lord. <br> <br> How good it is to sing praises to our God, <br> how pleasant and fitting to praise him! <br> <br> The Lord builds up Jerusalem&#59; <br> he gathers the exiles of Israel. <br> He heals the brokenhearted <br> and binds up their wounds. <br> He determines the number of the stars <br> and calls them each by name. <br> Great is our Lord and mighty in power&#59; <br> his understanding has no limit. <br> The Lord sustains the humble <br> but casts the wicked to the ground. <br> <br> Sing to the Lord with grateful praise&#59; <br> make music to our God on the harp. <br> <br> He covers the sky with clouds&#59; <br> he supplies the earth with rain <br> and makes grass grow on the hills. <br> He provides food for the cattle <br> and for the young ravens when they call. <br> <br> His pleasure is not in the strength of the horse, <br> nor his delight in the legs of the warrior&#59; <br> the Lord delights in those who fear him, <br> who put their hope in his unfailing love.

<p><img class="drop-cap" src="/src/img/drop-cap-a.svg"><span>A</span>bout four years ago I met a family who was separated with kids scattered throughout the foster system. I was confident God had called me to provide a temporary home for children in need, so I was sure that when this family came into my life that it was God-appointed. On saying “yes” to taking in a sweet little girl, I was promised that in just a short time she would go back home. My time serving her and God would be brief. I placed my hope in the promises of the foster system, that it would work the way it was made to work and this family that I was learning to love would be back together soon. If God had ordained this, wouldn’t my hope be fulfilled?</p>

Three long years later - three years of empty promises, false accusations, backslides, deep trauma and a whole lot of tears - the family was still apart. All my hope for them reuniting, for their hard work and love to be recognized and validated, and for the justice system to do its job was gone. My hope in God’s plans for redemption were gone, too. Psalms, like the one for today, telling of God’s great provision, care, and creation seemed to be mocking this family. It seemed as if time was up, and love had not won.

But then, like the shock of the son of God being born in a hay-filled mess of a manger, the tides changed. Love broke through. Wickedness and lies were revealed, and this family that had come to be my own was reunited. God had worked all things as they needed to be worked.

To hope is to be vulnerable. To be vulnerable means opening oneself up to the possibility of disappointment, heartache, and sorrow.

God is teaching me that when I am vulnerable, I will be met by love. When I am vulnerable, love will win. When love wins, it will not be on my terms or meet my deadlines. When love wins, it will be mind-blowingly more beautiful than I could ever imagine.

This Advent, let us hope together that:

<i>“The Lord heals the brokenhearted and binds up their wounds,” even during a long season of death.</i>

<i>“The Lord determines the number of stars and calls them each by name,” even when mental health crises, loneliness, and suicide rates are at an all-time high.</i>

<i>“The Lord sustains the humble but casts the wicked to the ground,” even when violence and evil seem to be in control. 
May we believe that the vulnerability of hope is worth it. Hope is coming, and it will show us the one true Wholeness.</i>

scripture_passage: And Mary said&#58; <br> <br> ‚ÄúMy soul glorifies the Lord <br>and my spirit rejoices in God my Savior, <br> for he has been mindful <br>of the humble state of his servant. <br> From now on all generations will call me blessed, <br> for the Mighty One has done great things for me‚Äî <br>holy is his name. <br> His mercy extends to those who fear him, <br> from generation to generation. <br> He has performed mighty deeds with his arm&#59; <br> he has scattered those who are proud in their inmost thoughts. <br> He has brought down rulers from their thrones <br> but has lifted up the humble. <br> He has filled the hungry with good things <br> but has sent the rich away empty. <br> He has helped his servant Israel, <br> remembering to be merciful <br> to Abraham and his descendants forever, <br> just as he promised our ancestors.‚Äù

We long for peace in these chaotic and fear-filled days. We are all aware the world is not as God desires it to be. We know we need peace individually and corporately. We need the peace only God can bring. Our passages and reflections this week will bring peace to you and encourage you to partner with God in bringing peace in our world. Do not be afraid to bring peace this week, even if it takes you outside your comfort zone.

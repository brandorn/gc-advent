scripture_passage: Do not be deceived&#59; God is not mocked, for you reap whatever you sow. If you sow to your own flesh, you will reap corruption from the flesh&#59; but if you sow to the Spirit, you will reap eternal life from the Spirit. So let us not grow weary in doing what is right, for we will reap at harvest time, if we do not give up. So then, whenever we have an opportunity, let us work for the good of all, and especially for those of the family of faith.

Monday nights from 6:00-7:30pm have been the most joyous moments of my week every week for the past 11 years. That’s approximately 858 hours of joy since I moved to this area. I can also say I’ve racked up approximately 858 hours of “good work” in the same time. These sacred hours occur at Reality Ministries, one of our beloved community partners. 

I’ve spent 8 of the past 11 years driving my dear friend Raul to and from the Reality Center each Monday night. Raul is unable to walk long distances and does not have a stable means of transportation to Reality each week. My “good work” includes going to his house, helping him get ready, driving him to the Reality Center, then doing it all in reverse at the end of the night.

To be clear, I don’t view this 
as a “good work.” This ritual of driving to and from Reality with Raul is one of the most grounding, essential, and joy-filled parts of each week. Raul is full of life and has so much joy for the smallest of things, like us singing in concert to Drake each car ride and whistling a special little tune as he goes up and down the stairs. 

I love that today’s passage on doing good works is assigned during the week of “harvest.” I tend to think of “good works” as part of the planting process, the “<i>If</i> I do good, <i>then</i> I will be rewarded” part. Instead, in this context, I am challenged to think of the good works AS the harvest, the gift, the bounty at the end of the season.

So yes, I do volunteer my time each week to help Raul get to Reality. I have a hardy chunk of hours that on any resume could shine as “volunteer work.” But looking at it that way misses the point and the promise of Jesus. Viewed as the harvest instead of the planting, I believe that good works are Jesus’s way of saying, “You give your time, and in return I give you one of my most precious gifts: my son Raul and all his love!”

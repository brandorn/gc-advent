scripture_passage: The wilderness and the dry land shall be glad,<br>the desert shall rejoice and blossom&#59;<br>like the crocus it shall blossom abundantly,<br>and rejoice with joy and singing.<br>The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it,<br>the majesty of Carmel and Sharon.<br>They shall see the glory of the Lord,<br>the majesty of our God.<br><br>Strengthen the weak hands,<br>and make firm the feeble knees.<br>Say to those who are of a fearful heart,<br>“Be strong, do not fear!<br>Here is your God.<br>He will come with vengeance,<br>with terrible recompense.<br>He will come and save you.”<br><br>Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened,<br>and the ears of the deaf unstopped&#59;<br>then the lame shall leap like a deer,<br>and the tongue of the speechless sing for joy.<br>For waters shall break forth in the wilderness,<br>and streams in the desert&#59;<br>the burning sand shall become a pool,<br>and the thirsty ground springs of water;<br>the haunt of jackals shall become a swamp,<br>the grass shall become reeds and rushes.<br><br>A highway shall be there,<br>and it shall be called the Holy Way&#59;<br>the unclean shall not travel on it,<br>but it shall be for God's people;<br>no traveler, not even fools, shall go astray.<br>No lion shall be there,<br>nor shall any ravenous beast come up on it;<br>they shall not be found there,<br>but the redeemed shall walk there.<br>And the ransomed of the Lord shall return,<br>and come to Zion with singing&#59;<br>everlasting joy shall be upon their heads&#59;<br>they shall obtain joy and gladness,<br>and sorrow and sighing shall flee away.

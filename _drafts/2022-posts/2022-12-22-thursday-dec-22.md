scripture_passage: In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, keeping watch over their flock by night. Then an angel of the Lord stood before them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified. But the angel said to them, “Do not be afraid&#59; for see—I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people&#58; to you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, who is the Messiah, the Lord. This will be a sign for you&#58; you will find a child wrapped in bands of cloth and lying in a manger.” And suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of the heavenly host, praising God and saying,<br> <br> “Glory to God in the highest heaven,<br> and on earth peace among those whom he favors!”

I have a confession to make, I don't really enjoy Christmas music. I know, I know that's weird, especially for someone who loves music.

However, I have one exception. The one Christmas album that I could listen to all year long is Amy Grant's <i>A Christmas Album</i>. She's wearing this amazing Christmas sweater on the cover and standing in front of a backdrop with a snowy mountain and majestic looking barn.

I can't tell you why this is the only Christmas album I enjoy. Maybe it's because it reminds me of my childhood Christmases. We'd listen to it every year as we made the three hour trip to see my grandparents in Virginia. From the back of our minivan, I would sing dramatically at the top of my lungs while my sister would roll her eyes and laugh (not much has changed).

A favorite song can activate our memories. Think of a song you haven't heard in a while, maybe your favorite Christmas song or a song from your childhood. Incredibly, we can still sing many of them word for word. We remember the stories told in songs and the stories that surround those songs. We remember stories of family trips, heartaches, celebrations, friendships, changes, and growing pains. Those songs have the power to bring the past into the present!

My favorite song on that Amy Grant album is "Love Has Come." The song so beautifully shares the story of Luke 2 intertwined with visions of modern Christmas celebrations. The past and present are brought together. I will always believe one of the best ways to tell stories is through song. A good song awakens our imaginations and sets them free to run wild. Our beloved songs find a home deep in our hearts and take root there. But the songs and the stories don't stay there. They come out in our lives. We share them with our voices and bring them to life again.

Each time I read the story of Jesus' birth in Luke 2, I always imagine the angels singing verse 14 rather than just saying it. The arrival of Jesus calls forth a song. The good news is so important it must be sung; it must be remembered; it must be shared.

Can you hear the angels singing?

<i>“Glory to God in the highest heaven,<br>
and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased.”</i>

<i>If you were to write your own song to share the good news of Jesus' arrival, what would you sing?</i>

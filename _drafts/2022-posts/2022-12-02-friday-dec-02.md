scripture: Jeremiah 29.1-11
scripture_passage: These are the words of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the remaining elders among the exiles and to the priests, the prophets, and all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. This was after King Jeconiah and the queen mother, the court officials, the leaders of Judah and Jerusalem, the artisans, and the smiths had departed from Jerusalem. The letter was sent by the hand of Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah sent to Babylon to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.<br> <br>It said&#58 Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles whom I have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon&#58 Build houses and live in them&#59 plant gardens and eat what they produce. Take wives and have sons and daughters&#59 take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters&#59 multiply there, and do not decrease. But seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare. For thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel&#58 Do not let the prophets and the diviners who are among you deceive you, and do not listen to your dreams that you dream, for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name&#59 I did not send them, says the Lord.<br> <br>For thus says the Lord&#58 Only when Babylon’s seventy years are completed will I visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and bring you back to this place. For surely I know the plans I have for you, says the Lord, plans for your welfare and not for harm, to give you a future with hope.

It’s one thing to experience pain and grief; it’s another thing to be told to endure that grief just a little longer. The Babylonian exile was a profound disjuncture in the life of ancient Israel. With the two successive military campaigns on Jerusalem in 597 and 586 BC resulting in the devastation of the city and deportations of the people to Babylon, the kingdom of Judah had come to an end, forcing the survivors to reckon with how to make sense of their identity as a people now that God’s promises to David had apparently been nullified.

While the message of Jeremiah to the exiles (here, shortly after 597 BC) is ultimately hopeful, we diminish their significance if we fail to recognize the confusion, pain, and anger that must have been present in the exiled community in Babylon, especially in the immediate aftermath of the crisis. As another poet in exile exclaims, “How can we sing the songs of the LORD while in a foreign land?” (Ps. 137:4). And yet, the word of God to the people through Jeremiah is one of persistence: Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce. In other words, make the best of this terrible situation. Put one foot in front of the other and move forward, for insofar as you promote the welfare of those around you in these foreign surroundings, you will be able to salvage some good in the midst of crisis. 

In fact, part of Jeremiah’s point in this letter was precisely to disabuse the exiled community of the notion that the ordeal would be over quickly. (When this letter was written, the final destruction of Jerusalem in 586 BC had not even happened yet.) God’s promises do not always come quickly. The life of faith is characterized by sometimes unspeakably long stretches of uncertainty and doubt. But there is usually some good that we can pursue in the midst of the uncertainty, even if it does not resolve the fundamental questions that we may have.

As Advent is a season of waiting and anticipation, may we cultivate the kind of patience that Jeremiah describes, learning to see the good in an otherwise dark and broken world, and contemplating creative ways to promote the welfare of the places where God has put us.

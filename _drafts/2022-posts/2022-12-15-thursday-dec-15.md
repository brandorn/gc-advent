scripture_passage: As it is written, “He scatters abroad, he gives to the poor&#59; his righteousness endures forever.”<br><br>He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness. You will be enriched in every way for your great generosity, which will produce thanksgiving to God through us&#59; for the rendering of this ministry not only supplies the needs of the saints but also overflows with many thanksgivings to God. Through the testing of this ministry you glorify God by your obedience to the confession of the gospel of Christ and by the generosity of your sharing with them and with all others, while they long for you and pray for you because of the surpassing grace of God that he has given you. Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!

The summers of my (Carlos) youth were marked by three things:

<ul>
	<li><p>My great-grandmother, Lillie, coming down from DC to spend the summer break with us,</p></li>
	<li><p>Practicing and playing in All-Star baseball tournaments, and</p></li>
	<li><p>Working in the garden with my grandfather.</p></li>
</ul>

If I wasn't in the living room betting pennies in a card game with Lillie or at baseball practice perfecting my unhittable curveball, I was riding on that old tractor with grandaddy. Seriously, these are the three things I did, day in and day out. 

As you can imagine, having to work in the garden during summer break was not my favorite way to spend my time as a teenager. My legs always itched from critter bites, and my thumbs were always green and sore from shelling hundreds of peas a day. 

Even though it was hard work, I look back on those scorching days in the fields with no regrets. I remember a little bit about the tilling of the soil and the planting of the seeds, but what I remember most are the harvests. The fruits of our labor kept food on the table for our immediate family, our extended family, our church family, and our neighbors. Grandma would crank up the pressure cooker, pull out the Mason jars, and fill the shelves and freezer with enough vegetables to get us through many, many meals. But for every three bushels we harvested, at least one bushel went to a cousin or a church member. Honestly I remember giving away just as much food as we kept, every single year. 

In the winter of my 8th grade year, my grandfather passed away. I moved in with my grandmother to help her with chores and to keep her company. Eventually we ceased to have a garden. Early one morning the following summer, I heard something outside on the back porch. I went out to investigate and found two buckets of peas, a bucket of corn, and a bag of okra. I saw Deacon Buie getting into his car, and as he drove off he said, "Tell your grandma I said hello." We received blessings of this nature every week during the summer for many years after. 

Our harvest, no matter how puny _or_ abundant, is meant to be shared. 

This is not a one and done deal. God will supply our needs so we can CONTINUE to bless others. We all go through seasons in which we just don't have much to give, but that does not mean that we stop giving. It means that we do what we can until we enter into a season of abundance. And when we enter into that season of abundance, we again bless others with what we have received. We are all created to be blessings. God intends for us to care for and take care of one another.

scripture_passage: He put before them another parable&#58; “The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that someone took and sowed in his field&#59; it is the smallest of all the seeds, but when it has grown it is the greatest of shrubs and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches.”

<i>“Daddy, what is this?”</i>

My son asks me this all the time. Either to his joy or confusion, I prepare a thesis-like response to every question. He’s probably hoping for a simple answer like: “That’s a red truck,” or “Daddy and Poppi helped build those vehicles before you were born.”

Instead, as a former builder myself, I go on and on into deep and lengthy explanations. I might cover the history of the internal combustion engine, explain the importance of Ford’s factory line, and detail the inevitable shift from gas to electric vehicles he will see in his lifetime. These are the explanations I believe are relevant. But my son does not understand my answers. He is two, after all.

<i>“Daddy, what is this?”</i>

What if I simply, humbly asked our Heavenly Father this same question? God, what is this seed of faith that you have planted in my heart? How would that question change my life?

I often interrogate the planted seed, trying to understand it and even command it at my own will. I pound on the outside of its miniature shell, yelling “Save me! Save them! Help me through this! Do this for me!” I don’t understand how the seed remains alive in the ground it was planted in, pressured by the demands and fears I place on it. I believe this rootedness is one of God’s many miracles.

The longest journey of my spiritual life is the path between accepting this seed of faith and abiding by that faith. I am still learning to abide. Abiding allows us to ask questions _and_ accept the answers provided, especially the answers we don’t understand.

What if I released the tension of anxiety and fear in my heart and accepted that there are things I simply cannot understand? There are things that will not respond to my commands. My will alone cannot make the seed grow. Would that acceptance quiet the decades of confusion and insecurity around what it means to walk with God? Is abiding the act of accepting the seed as it is, then simply watching it grow?

What if I simply looked at the seed and asked, <i>“Daddy, what is this?”</i> and waited.

Today, I feel our Father respond: <i>The seed is the potential for cascading love, my son</i>.

I do not know how the seed might transform our world, our communal injustices, and our collective sin. I cannot understand the vastness of our sadness, exploitations, and abuses. I cannot fathom how all have fallen short of the glory of God, yet God continues to care for us, nourish us and transform us so we may love each other better.

But our Father knows that I can sit and watch the planted seed grow each day, and I can remember: <i>The seed is the potential for cascading love, my son</i>.

scripture: Daniel 2.17-23
scripture_passage: Then Daniel went to his home and informed his companions, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, and told them to seek mercy from the God of heaven concerning this mystery, so that Daniel and his companions with the rest of the wise men of Babylon might not perish. Then the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision of the night, and Daniel blessed the God of heaven. <br><br>Daniel said&#58; <br> “Blessed be the name of God from age to age, <br> for wisdom and power are his. <br> He changes times and seasons, <br> deposes kings and sets up kings&#59; <br> he gives wisdom to the wise <br> and knowledge to those who have understanding. <br> He reveals deep and hidden things&#59; <br> he knows what is in the darkness, <br> and light dwells with him. <br> To you, O God of my ancestors, <br> I give thanks and praise, <br> for you have given me wisdom and power, <br> and have now revealed to me what we asked of you, <br> for you have revealed to us what the king ordered.”

How much light is needed in a room to delete darkness? Only a few waves, a few particles of light from a single energy source can cast comprehension into a space of ignorance. It is a marvel, a truly beautiful thing that the light does not cast out darkness, but instead reforms the space into a comprehensible alignment of figures and meaning. One breath of light in any previous dark place casts understanding and the potential for God's workmanship through the body to begin.

Daniel praised God, blessed God's name and sought to align his own will to the Lord's. Daniel did not lean on his own understanding but looked to the source of all light for the power to see. God, the source of all light, showed up in the darkness of night to reveal and provide understanding. God doesn’t seem to have any issues seeing in the dark or helping us to see what is needed.

God knows what is in the darkness and reveals deep and hidden things. The light dwells with God.

The light within God is the very same light God gives to each of us. That light, that love and grace to shine in the direction of the void of darkness allows the aperture of our hearts to see what is hidden, what is true and what is beautiful, a space where God needed us to shine God's light.

scripture_passage: Now about eight days after these sayings Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray. And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazzling white. Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him. They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem. Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep&#59; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him. Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here&#59; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said. While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them&#59; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud. Then from the cloud came a voice that said, “This is my Son, my Chosen&#59; listen to him!” When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.

<b>Seeing What God Wants Us to See</b>

Sometimes I meet with couples who have lost the way of their love. Conflict, neglect or just the ordinary challenges of life overshadow the light of their first passion. I wish they could see what I can see in them. There is almost always still a hint of the glory of the love that brought them together.

Sometimes seeing what is right in front of us is difficult.

In Luke 9:28-36 Jesus invited his three main disciples up on a mountain to pray. As Jesus prayed, he was transfigured. His appearance and clothing became as bright as the light from a flash of lightning.  Personally, my praying has never produced a transfiguring, although I hope that an inward transformation is happening.

But there is more. Company shows up. Moses and Elijah! Peter, James and John are described as having been sleepy (which seems to be their usual response when privately praying with Jesus), but they are suddenly wide awake and see his glory. As Moses and Elijah are leaving, Peter comes up with a great idea (although no one asked him, and it clearly seemed to be one of those ‘speak only if spoken to’ moments). “How about if we build three monuments?” Even Luke cringes when reporting this and adds the editorial comment, “He did not know what he was saying” (NIV).

Suddenly, instead of a bright light, a dark cloud overshadows them, and they are transfigured from amazement to fear.
“This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him.”

They nearly missed it – the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ (2 Corinthians 4:6). And they were looking right at it. There is no point in seeing a great light unless we see in it what God wants us to see. And we can be sure of this: what God wants us to see will have something to do with Jesus, whom God has chosen, and the best instruction will be, “Listen to him.
So, whether marriage, singleness, work, family, or any other dimension of our life, when should we not listen? Or more positively, what might happen if we do?

Where might you listen today to the One God has chosen?

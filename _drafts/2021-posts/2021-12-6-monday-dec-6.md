scripture_passage: Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been engaged to Joseph, but before they lived together, she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to expose her to public disgrace, planned to dismiss her quietly. But just when he had resolved to do this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream and said, “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife, for the child conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. She will bear a son, and you are to name him Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins.” All this took place to fulfill what had been spoken by the Lord through the prophet&#58; <br><br> “Look, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, <br> and they shall name him Emmanuel,” <br><br> which means, “God is with us.” When Joseph awoke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him; he took her as his wife, but had no marital relations with her until she had borne a son&#59; and he named him Jesus.

Here on earth, our lives are largely composed of decisions. We make tiny, daily decisions like what time to get out of bed, how to greet the person we pass on the sidewalk or which item to order off the menu. We face more formative decisions like what career to pursue, how to talk to our children about evil in the world or how to invest our time. And then there are completely gut-wrenching decisions like how to set necessary boundaries with people who still need help, when to stop medical treatment for loved ones or how to respond to betrayal.

We meet Joseph, “a righteous man,” on a night where he is faced with one of these impossible decisions.

Maybe we’ve never faced a decision with such high stakes as the one Joseph faces here - becoming the earthly father of the Savior of the world - but most of us would pray that, in the throes of our important decisions and darkest nights, God would send an angel/sign/vision like He does here for Joseph. If we had such an obvious sign, of course we’d align our decision with God’s plan. 

Right?

We live in an era in which there is a lot of black-and-white, moral code reasoning coming at us from all sides. In a world where we’re flooded with information and evidence and “shoulds” and “should nots,” it can be very easy to reason through the right and wrong of a situation and feel entirely justified in our rationale. Many of us have strong, deeply rooted convictions. We can infer from this passage that Joseph was a man of conviction as well.

But there’s a key element on which the rest of the story hinges completely: even with his conviction and his “faithful[ness] to the law,” (NIV) Joseph’s heart was clearly open, soft and ready to be molded by God.

Joseph’s initial response, given that he had every logical reason to think he had been betrayed, leaves a powerful impression. He shows great compassion and restraint, actively trying to spare Mary humiliation but remaining faithful to the law. Joseph doesn’t appear as flawed as the rest of us because he seems to be making such a “good decision” without letting anger heavily influence his response. It’s hard to fault him for the choice he’s made by the time he goes to bed that night.

And yet ... God has other plans for Joseph. The correct, upright, “good decision” made by this righteous man is not the RIGHT decision. Enter the angel.

In our moments of darkness, fear, anger or doubt, we pray that our “good decisions” and gut feelings might be coupled with a soft and malleable heart like Joseph’s, ready and open to being proven wrong by the Holy Spirit. We pray that God would overshadow even our best intentions and most earnest efforts to respond faithfully to the chaos we’re confronted with in daily life and in the darkest night. We don’t want to miss the angel in the dream - or maybe more likely, to reason our way into thinking “it was just a dream.” God, overshadow us.

“O Christ, let my doubts never compel me <br>
to hide my heart from you. <br>
Let them rather arise as questions <br>
to begin holy conversations. <br>
Invert these doubts, <br>
turning them to invitations to be present, <br>
          	to be honest, <br>
          	to seek you, <br>
          	to cry out to you, <br>
          	to bring my heart fully into the struggle <br>
rather than to seek to numb it. <br> <br>
Let my doubts become invitations to wrestle<br>
with you through such dark nights of the soul<br>
--as Jacob wrestled with the Angel<br>
--until the day breaks anew<br>
and I am fresh wounded by your love<br>
and resting in the blessing of peace<br>
          	again in your presence.”

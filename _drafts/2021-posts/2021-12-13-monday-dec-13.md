scripture_passage: Where can I go from your spirit? <br> Or where can I flee from your presence? <br> If I ascend to heaven, you are there&#59; <br> if I make my bed in Sheol, you are there. <br> If I take the wings of the morning <br> and settle at the farthest limits of the sea, <br> even there your hand shall lead me, <br> and your right hand shall hold me fast. <br> If I say, “Surely the darkness shall cover me, <br> and the light around me become night,” <br> even the darkness is not dark to you&#59; <br> the night is as bright as the day, <br> for darkness is as light to you. <br> <br> For it was you who formed my inward parts&#59; <br> you knit me together in my mother’s womb. <br> I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. <br> Wonderful are your works&#59; <br> that I know very well. <br> My frame was not hidden from you, <br> when I was being made in secret, <br> intricately woven in the depths of the earth.

As a child, my father basically had 3 rules of the house:
<ol>
	<li><p>You will respect your elders at all times (which meant always do as they say.)</p></li>
	<li><p>You will go to church on Sundays.</p></li>
	<li><p>You WILL be a Carolina fan.</p></li>
</ol>

Rules 1 and 2 were a bit challenging at times, but number 3 was never a problem. Being a Carolina fan came naturally. Dean Smith, Phil Ford, Bob McAdoo, Lawrence Taylor, and of course, Michael Jordan were household names. I’m pretty sure I heard Woody Durham’s voice more than any of our pastors over the years. The beauty of all this for me was that anytime Carolina played I spent time with my dad. We couldn’t afford many tickets to basketball games, but dad somehow made a way for us to attend football games and eventually bought football season tickets. Needless to say, many of my fondest memories with my dad involve our shared love for Carolina.

On the morning of October 20th, 2020, my dad had a massive heart attack. After a couple of days in a hospital in Fayetteville, dad was airlifted to UNC hospital. For the next 8 days my step-mother and I spent 12 hours a day by his bedside hoping and praying God would allow us to see that light, that beautiful twinkle in his eyes we were all accustomed to seeing.

October 29th, 2020 was the darkest day of my life. We were told that my dad had suffered too much damage from the heart attack, and there was nothing else they could do for him. With every tear from my siblings my heart grew heavier and heavier; my spirit grew darker and darker. 

At 4:13am on October 30th Josephus Womack passed away. Needing some fresh air, I took the long, dark walk from my dad’s room down to an open courtyard on the first floor of the hospital. I walked to this courtyard every night during my visits to grab some coffee but mostly to get in a good cry. I sat in the darkest corner of the courtyard with my hoodie over my head so no one would see the tears streaming down my face. After several minutes I raised my head and looked to the gloomy morning sky. I asked God to grant me the understanding to accept His will and the strength to move on without one of the most important people in my life. As I was making my plea, an object came into focus through my watery eyes. I saw light. I saw light shining on the interlocking “NC” on the campus water tower. I had seen the water tower before but at this moment it seemed closer, brighter. The picture you see was taken at 5:05am, 52 minutes after my dad passed away. At that moment my tears started to fade, and my spirit felt a little bit lighter.

Psalm 139:12: “Even the darkness will not be dark to you; the night will shine like the day, for darkness is as light to you.” (NIV)
We may experience darkness taking over the light, but for God even the night shines like day.

During my darkest hour, God allowed me to see His light despite facing overwhelming darkness. Upon seeing the UNC symbol lit up in the darkness I began to realize the beauty of that moment. My mind flashed back to the long talks during the long walks up to the football stadium. I relived the excitement of my first basketball game with my dad at the old Carmichael Arena and at the Dean Dome. So many of my fondest memories with my dad were associated with UNC, and it was only fitting that in that place we spent those final days together. 

I felt as though, for just a few moments, God granted me the ability to see things through His eyes. The darkness that had consumed me through my dad’s illness, and eventual death, was replaced with reflection and appreciation, with light.
May you too be given the gift of seeing the light, even in your darkest hour.

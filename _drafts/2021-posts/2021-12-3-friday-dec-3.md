We meet the people of Israel in exile in today’s reading. They’re not sure where to go, how to make a new life, how to trust the God of their covenant, how not to feel abandoned by the God who created them, how to worship God without God’s dwelling place – the temple. The Israelites were facing an identity crisis, feeling as if they no longer belonged to God as God’s people. But then, through the prophet Isaiah, God speaks these words of hope.

Isaiah reminds them and us that our God is the one who created the heavens to cover all the earth, the God who puts breath in our lungs, and is the breath in our lungs, the God who has given the Spirit to dwell among us on Earth. This is a God who continually calls us, reaches out and takes us by the hand, and not only takes us, but keeps us.

The Israelites, even in exile, were still people who belonged to God and belonged to the covenant God created. The Israelites were called to remember they were covenantal people and their covenant with God extended past themselves to all other nations.

In the section before our passage, Isaiah gives word to God’s servant, a servant who will “faithfully bring justice” to all nations, and in verses 5-9 we see how that servant will bring justice to the world. The servant will bring justice by opening the eyes of the blind, bringing prisoners out of the dungeon, bringing light into the darkness. God sends the servant to bring light to the darkness.
In the season of Advent, we wait in hopeful prayer for Jesus’s arrival. We know Jesus comes, yet we must sit, wait and pray. We hold hope while we wait, and what a glorious arrival we await!

With the coming of Jesus, we hope for justice to be brought to Earth. The servant could arrive at any moment, and with the coming of the servant there will be justice, righteousness and light.

As we wait for the coming of the servant Jesus, we remember that we are not much different than the 6th century Israelites stuck in exile. The pattern of servanthood throughout Scripture and Christian tradition comes to fruition in the birth of the Son of God. In Luke 4:18-19, we read he brings good news to the poor, release to the captives, sight to the blind, and freedom to the oppressed.
As you journey through the Advent season, remember that Jesus comes to bring light to the dark, just as Isaiah prophesied God would do. Remember that our God is one who reaches out a hand and holds us while we wait for the light of justice, righteousness and peace.
